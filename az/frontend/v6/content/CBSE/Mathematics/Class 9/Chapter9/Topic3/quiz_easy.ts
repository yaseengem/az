    ],
    correctAnswer: "The chord at 6 cm distance from the center",
    explanation: "Using c = 2‚àö(r¬≤ - d¬≤), the chord at 6 cm has length 2‚àö(10¬≤ - 6¬≤) = 2‚àö64 = 16 cm, while the chord at 8 cm has length 2‚àö(10¬≤ - 8¬≤) = 2‚àö36 = 12 cm. So the chord closer to the center is longer. üîç",

    correctAnswer: "A chord passing through the center",
    explanation: "A chord passing through the center has the maximum possible length, equal to the diameter (2r). This is because the distance from center is zero, maximizing the formula c = 2‚àö(r¬≤ - d¬≤) to c = 2r. üìà",
