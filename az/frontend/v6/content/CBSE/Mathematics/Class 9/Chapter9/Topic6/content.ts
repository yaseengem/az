# Summary of Circle Theorems and Properties 🔄

Welcome to the final section of our chapter on circles! 🌟 In this topic, we'll consolidate all the important concepts we've learned about circles into a comprehensive summary. This will serve as a quick reference guide for you when solving problems related to circles. Let's dive in! 🚀

## Circle Basics ⭕

A **circle** is a collection of all points in a plane that are at a fixed distance (called the radius) from a fixed point (called the center).

**Key Elements**:
- **Center**: The fixed point from which all points on the circle are equidistant
- **Radius**: The fixed distance from the center to any point on the circle
- **Diameter**: A line segment that passes through the center and has both endpoints on the circle (twice the radius)
- **Chord**: A line segment with both endpoints on the circle
- **Arc**: A portion of the circle's circumference
- **Sector**: A region bounded by two radii and an arc
- **Segment**: A region bounded by a chord and an arc

## Angles Subtended by an Arc at a Point 📐

### 1. Angle at the Center vs. Angle at the Circumference

**Theorem**: The angle subtended by an arc at the center of a circle is twice the angle subtended by the same arc at any point on the remaining part of the circle.

Mathematically: ∠AOB = 2 × ∠APB

Where:
- O is the center of the circle
- A and B are points on the circle forming an arc
- P is any point on the circle (not on the arc AB)

### 2. Angles in the Same Segment

**Theorem**: Angles in the same segment of a circle are equal.

If P and Q are two points on the same arc of a circle, and A and B are the endpoints of a chord, then:
∠PAB = ∠QAB

### 3. Angle in a Semicircle

**Theorem**: The angle in a semicircle is a right angle (90°).

If AB is a diameter of a circle and P is any point on the circle, then:
∠APB = 90°

### 4. Angle in Alternate Segment

**Theorem**: The angle between a tangent to a circle and a chord drawn from the point of contact is equal to the angle in the alternate segment.

If a tangent at point A on a circle forms an angle with chord AB, this angle equals the angle in the alternate segment:
∠BAT = ∠ACB (where T is on the tangent at A)

## Chords of a Circle 📏

### 1. Perpendicular from Center to Chord

**Theorem**: The perpendicular from the center of a circle to a chord bisects the chord.

If O is the center of a circle and AB is any chord, then the perpendicular from O to AB meets AB at point M such that:
AM = MB

### 2. Equal Chords and Their Distance from Center

**Theorem**: Equal chords of a circle are equidistant from the center of the circle.

If chords AB and CD are equal in length, and OM and ON are perpendiculars from the center O to these chords, then:
OM = ON

### 3. Chord Length and Distance from Center

If a chord of length c is at a distance d from the center of a circle with radius r, then:
c = 2√(r² - d²)

### 4. Chord Through Center

**Theorem**: Any chord passing through the center of a circle is a diameter and is the longest chord.

## Cyclic Quadrilaterals 🔄

### 1. Definition

A **cyclic quadrilateral** is a four-sided polygon whose vertices all lie on a single circle.

### 2. Sum of Opposite Angles

**Theorem**: In a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of opposite angles is 180° (supplementary).

If ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral, then:
∠A + ∠C = 180°
∠B + ∠D = 180°

### 3. External Angle Property

**Theorem**: The external angle of a cyclic quadrilateral is equal to the internal opposite angle.

If ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral and ∠ADE is an external angle at D, then:
∠ADE = ∠ABC

## Tangents to a Circle ✳️

### 1. Perpendicularity of Tangent and Radius

**Theorem**: A tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of contact.

If a line is tangent to a circle at point P, and O is the center of the circle, then:
OP ⊥ tangent at P

### 2. Equal Tangents

**Theorem**: Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length.

If from an external point P, two tangents PA and PB are drawn to a circle with center O, then:
PA = PB

### 3. Tangent-Chord Angles

**Theorem**: The angle between a tangent and chord drawn from the point of contact is equal to the angle in the alternate segment.

## Practical Applications of Circle Properties 🌍

The properties of circles have numerous applications in various fields:

1. **Architecture and Engineering**: Designing arches, domes, and circular structures

2. **Navigation and Astronomy**: Celestial navigation, orbits of planets

3. **Optics and Physics**: Lens design, reflection of light

4. **Art and Design**: Creating patterns, proportions in artistic compositions

5. **Surveying and Construction**: Laying out circular foundations, measuring angles

## Common Problem-Solving Techniques 🛠️

When tackling problems involving circles, consider these approaches:

1. **Draw a clear diagram**: Represent all the given information accurately

2. **Identify the key elements**: Determine which circle properties are relevant

3. **Apply appropriate theorems**: Match the problem situation with the theorems we've learned

4. **Look for special cases**: Check if angles are in a semicircle, or if chords are equal

5. **Work stepwise**: Break complex problems into simpler parts

## Quick Reference Guide: Circle Formulas 📊

1. **Circle Area**: A = πr²
2. **Circle Circumference**: C = 2πr
3. **Arc Length**: s = rθ (where θ is in radians)
4. **Sector Area**: A = (θ/2)r² (where θ is in radians)
5. **Chord Length**: c = 2r·sin(θ/2) (where θ is the central angle)
6. **Distance from Center to Chord**: d = r·cos(θ/2) (where θ is the central angle)

## Example Questions and Solutions 📝

**Example 1**: In a circle with center O, chord AB subtends an angle of 60° at the center. If the radius of the circle is 10 cm, find the length of chord AB.

**Solution**:
Using the chord length formula: c = 2r·sin(θ/2)
c = 2 × 10 × sin(60°/2)
c = 20 × sin(30°)
c = 20 × 0.5
c = 10 cm

**Example 2**: A circle has radius 8 cm. Two parallel chords are drawn at distances 3 cm and 5 cm from the center. Find the length of each chord.

**Solution**:
For the first chord at distance d₁ = 3 cm:
c₁ = 2√(r² - d₁²)
c₁ = 2√(8² - 3²)
c₁ = 2√(64 - 9)
c₁ = 2√55
c₁ ≈ 14.83 cm

For the second chord at distance d₂ = 5 cm:
c₂ = 2√(r² - d₂²)
c₂ = 2√(8² - 5²)
c₂ = 2√(64 - 25)
c₂ = 2√39
c₂ ≈ 12.49 cm

**Example 3**: In a circle, two chords AB and CD intersect at point P. If AP = 3 cm, PB = 4 cm, CP = 2 cm, find PD.

**Solution**:
Using the power of a point theorem: AP × PB = CP × PD
3 × 4 = 2 × PD
12 = 2 × PD
PD = 6 cm

**Example 4**: ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral with ∠A = 110° and ∠B = 70°. Find the measures of ∠C and ∠D.

**Solution**:
In a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles are supplementary:
∠A + ∠C = 180°
110° + ∠C = 180°
∠C = 70°

Similarly:
∠B + ∠D = 180°
70° + ∠D = 180°
∠D = 110°

## Common Misconceptions to Avoid ⚠️

1. **Confusing arcs**: Remember that when referring to an angle subtended by an arc, specify whether it's a minor or major arc.

2. **Misapplying theorems**: The theorem "angle at center = 2 × angle at circumference" applies only when the point on the circumference is on the opposite side of the arc.

3. **Assuming all quadrilaterals are cyclic**: Not every quadrilateral can be inscribed in a circle; verify that opposite angles are supplementary.

4. **Misidentifying tangents**: Remember that a tangent meets the circle at exactly one point and is perpendicular to the radius at that point.

## Summary of Key Points ✨

1. **Angles**:
   - Angle at center = 2 × angle at circumference
   - Angles in the same segment are equal
   - Angle in a semicircle is 90°

2. **Chords**:
   - Perpendicular from center to chord bisects the chord
   - Equal chords are equidistant from the center
   - Chord length formula: c = 2√(r² - d²)

3. **Cyclic Quadrilaterals**:
   - Opposite angles are supplementary (sum to 180°)
   - External angle equals opposite interior angle

4. **Tangents**:
   - Tangent is perpendicular to radius at point of contact
   - Tangents from external point are equal
