    correctAnswer: "72¬∞",
    explanation: "If a chord of length c subtends an angle Œ∏ at the center, then c = 2r√ósin(Œ∏/2). So 18 = 2√ó15√ósin(Œ∏/2), giving sin(Œ∏/2) = 0.6. Therefore, Œ∏/2 = 36.9¬∞ and Œ∏ ‚âà 72¬∞. This links chord length to central angle. üìê",

    ],
    correctAnswer: "12 cm",
    explanation: "For chords at distances d‚ÇÅ = 6 cm and d‚ÇÇ = 8 cm from the center, if lines containing these chords intersect at point P at distance x from the center, then by the chord-secant power relationship, x = (d‚ÇÅ √ó d‚ÇÇ)/r = (6 √ó 8)/4 = 12 cm. üîç",

      "10 cm": "This equals the radius of the circle and doesn't satisfy the geometric relationship for intersecting chord lines.",
      "14 cm": "This value doesn't satisfy the geometric relationship for intersecting chord lines.",
      "16 cm": "This value doesn't satisfy the geometric relationship for intersecting chord lines."
