        correctAnswer: "A value of x for which P(x) = 0",
        explanation: "A zero (or root) of a polynomial P(x) is a value of x for which P(x) = 0. It's where the polynomial equals zero when that value is substituted for the variable. üåü",

            "A value of x for which P(x) = 1": "A zero specifically makes the polynomial equal to 0, not 1.",

        options: ["0", "5", "-5", "Cannot be determined"],
        correctAnswer: "5",
        explanation: "To find the zero, we set P(x) = 0 and solve: x - 5 = 0, which gives x = 5. When we substitute x = 5 into the polynomial, we get P(5) = 5 - 5 = 0, confirming that 5 is the zero. üî¢",

        explanation: "To find the zero, we set P(x) = 0 and solve: 2x + 8 = 0, which gives 2x = -8, so x = -4. We can verify that P(-4) = 2(-4) + 8 = -8 + 8 = 0. üìè",

        explanation: "To find the zeroes, we set P(x) = 0 and solve: x¬≤ - 4 = 0, which gives x¬≤ = 4, so x = ¬±2. When x = 2, P(2) = 2¬≤ - 4 = 4 - 4 = 0, confirming that 2 is a zero. (Note that -2 is also a zero, but it's not among the options.) üßÆ",

        correctAnswer: "(x - k)",
        explanation: "According to the Factor Theorem, if k is a zero of a polynomial P(x), then (x - k) is a factor of P(x). This means P(x) can be written as P(x) = (x - k) √ó Q(x) for some polynomial Q(x). üìä",
