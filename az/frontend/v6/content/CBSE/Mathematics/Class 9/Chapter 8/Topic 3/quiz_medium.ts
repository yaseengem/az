        explanation: "In a rhombus, diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Let's say AC = 2x (the longer diagonal) and BD = 12 cm (the shorter diagonal). Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle AOB: AB¬≤ = AO¬≤ + BO¬≤. Since O is the midpoint of diagonals, AO = x and BO = 6. So 10¬≤ = x¬≤ + 6¬≤. Solving: x¬≤ = 100 - 36 = 64 ‚üπ x = 8.

        explanation: "In trapezium ABCD with AB ‚à• DC, if AB = BC = CD, then it must be isosceles with AD = BC. Since AB = BC = CD, angles B and C are in an equilateral triangle.

        explanation: "Since AE:EC = 1:2, point E divides AC in the ratio 1:2, meaning E is positioned at 1/3 of AC from A. Similarly, F is at 1/3 of diagonal AC from A. In a parallelogram, triangles on opposite sides with the same proportional division of the diagonal have areas in inverse proportion. So, area of triangle DCE = 2 √ó area of triangle ABF = 2 √ó 8 = 16 cm¬≤. üìä",
        wrongAnswerExplanations: {
            "4 cm¬≤": "This incorrectly assumes the area ratio is directly proportional to the diagonal division ratio.",
            "8 cm¬≤": "This assumes equal areas, which isn't correct given the proportional positions of E and F.",
            "24 cm¬≤": "This overestimates the area relationship between the triangles."

        question: "In a quadrilateral ABCD, the midpoints of the sides AB, BC, CD, and DA are joined in order to form quadrilateral PQRS. If the area of ABCD is 64 cm¬≤, what is the area of PQRS?",
        options: ["16 cm¬≤", "32 cm¬≤", "48 cm¬≤", "56 cm¬≤"],
        correctAnswer: "32 cm¬≤",
        explanation: "When the midpoints of consecutive sides of any quadrilateral are joined, the resulting quadrilateral is a parallelogram with area exactly half of the original quadrilateral. This can be proven using vector analysis or by applying the Mid-point Theorem twice. Therefore, area of PQRS = (1/2) √ó area of ABCD = (1/2) √ó 64 = 32 cm¬≤. üîç",
        wrongAnswerExplanations: {
            "16 cm¬≤": "This incorrectly assumes the area is 1/4 of the original, not 1/2.",
            "48 cm¬≤": "This overestimates the area reduction and doesn't align with the midpoint connection property.",
            "56 cm¬≤": "This significantly overestimates the area and doesn't follow the mathematical relationship."
