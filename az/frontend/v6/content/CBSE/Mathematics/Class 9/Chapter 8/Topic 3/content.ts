# Summary of Quadrilaterals 📐

This chapter has explored quadrilaterals, focusing on their properties, special types, and important theorems. Let's summarize the key concepts we've learned about these fascinating four-sided shapes! ✨

## What is a Quadrilateral? 🔍

A quadrilateral is a closed polygon with exactly four sides, four vertices, and four angles. The sum of interior angles of any quadrilateral is always 360°.

For a quadrilateral ABCD:
- It has four sides: AB, BC, CD, and DA
- It has four vertices: A, B, C, and D
- It has four interior angles: ∠A, ∠B, ∠C, and ∠D
- Sum of interior angles = 360° (i.e., ∠A + ∠B + ∠C + ∠D = 360°)

## Types of Quadrilaterals 📋

### 1. Parallelogram
A quadrilateral whose opposite sides are parallel.

**Properties of a Parallelogram**:
- Opposite sides are parallel and equal: AB ∥ DC, AB = DC and BC ∥ AD, BC = AD
- Opposite angles are equal: ∠A = ∠C and ∠B = ∠D
- Diagonals bisect each other: If diagonals AC and BD intersect at point O, then AO = OC and BO = OD
- Sum of adjacent angles is 180°: ∠A + ∠B = 180°, ∠B + ∠C = 180°, etc.

**Verification**: A quadrilateral is a parallelogram if:
- Its opposite sides are parallel
- Its opposite sides are equal
- Its opposite angles are equal
- Its diagonals bisect each other
- Each diagonal divides it into two congruent triangles

### 2. Rectangle
A parallelogram with all interior angles as right angles (90°).

**Properties**:
- All properties of a parallelogram apply
- All four angles are 90° each
- Diagonals are equal: AC = BD
- The diagonals bisect each other: AO = OC and BO = OD

### 3. Square
A rectangle with all sides equal.

**Properties**:
- All properties of both rectangle and rhombus apply
- All four sides are equal: AB = BC = CD = DA
- All four angles are 90° each
- Diagonals are equal: AC = BD
- Diagonals bisect each other at right angles: AO = OC, BO = OD, and ∠AOB = 90°

### 4. Rhombus
A parallelogram with all sides equal.

**Properties**:
- All properties of a parallelogram apply
- All four sides are equal: AB = BC = CD = DA
- Diagonals bisect each other at right angles: AO ⊥ BO
- Diagonals bisect the opposite angles: AC bisects ∠A and ∠C

### 5. Kite
A quadrilateral with two pairs of adjacent sides equal.

**Properties**:
- If AB = BC and AD = CD, then:
  * One diagonal (BD) bisects the other diagonal (AC) at right angles
  * One diagonal (BD) is the perpendicular bisector of the other (AC)
  * One diagonal (AC) bisects a pair of opposite angles (∠A and ∠C)

### 6. Trapezium (Trapezoid)
A quadrilateral with exactly one pair of opposite sides parallel.

**Properties**:
- One pair of opposite sides is parallel (e.g., AB ∥ DC)
- If it's an isosceles trapezium (where non-parallel sides are equal), then:
  * The diagonals are equal: AC = BD
  * The angles along the same base are equal: ∠A = ∠B and ∠C = ∠D

## The Mid-point Theorem 🧠

**Statement**: The line joining the midpoints of any two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and equal to half of it.

For triangle ABC:
- If D is the midpoint of AB and E is the midpoint of AC
- Then DE ∥ BC and DE = ½BC

**Converse**: If a line through the midpoint of one side of a triangle is parallel to a second side, then it bisects the third side.

## Applications of Quadrilateral Properties 🛠️

### Example 1: Finding Missing Angles 📐

**Problem**: In parallelogram ABCD, if ∠A = 110°, find all the other angles.

**Solution**:
1. Since opposite angles in a parallelogram are equal: ∠C = ∠A = 110°
2. Since adjacent angles are supplementary (add up to 180°): ∠B = 180° - 110° = 70°
3. And ∠D = 180° - 110° = 70°

Therefore: ∠A = 110°, ∠B = 70°, ∠C = 110°, and ∠D = 70°

### Example 2: Using the Mid-point Theorem 📏

**Problem**: In triangle PQR, S is the midpoint of PQ and T is the midpoint of PR. If PQ = 8 cm and PR = 10 cm, find the length of ST.

**Solution**:
By the Mid-point Theorem, ST is parallel to QR and ST = ½QR
If we don't know QR directly, we can determine that ST = ½QR

### Example 3: Testing for a Parallelogram ✅

**Problem**: Determine if quadrilateral WXYZ with coordinates W(1, 1), X(4, 2), Y(5, 6), and Z(2, 5) is a parallelogram.

**Solution**:
1. Check if opposite sides are equal:
   * WX = √[(4-1)² + (2-1)²] = √[9 + 1] = √10
   * ZY = √[(5-2)² + (6-5)²] = √[9 + 1] = √10
   * XY = √[(5-4)² + (6-2)²] = √[1 + 16] = √17
   * WZ = √[(2-1)² + (5-1)²] = √[1 + 16] = √17
   
   Since WX = ZY and XY = WZ, opposite sides are equal.
   
2. Alternatively, check if diagonals bisect each other:
   * Midpoint of WY: (1+5)/2 = 3, (1+6)/2 = 3.5
   * Midpoint of XZ: (4+2)/2 = 3, (2+5)/2 = 3.5
   
   Since the midpoints are the same, the diagonals bisect each other.

Therefore, WXYZ is a parallelogram.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid ⚠️

1. **Assuming a quadrilateral is a parallelogram**: Check at least one of the defining conditions before concluding.
   
2. **Confusing properties**: Remember that while all squares are rectangles and rhombuses, not all rectangles or rhombuses are squares.
   
3. **Misapplying the Mid-point Theorem**: The theorem applies specifically to triangles, not directly to quadrilaterals.
   
4. **Forgetting key properties**: For instance, diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, but diagonals of a rectangle are only equal in length.

## Special Results 🌟

1. **Area of a parallelogram** = base × height
   
2. **Area of a trapezium** = ½ × (sum of parallel sides) × height
   
3. **If ABCD is a parallelogram, then**:
   * Triangle ABC ≅ Triangle CDA (congruent triangles)
   * Area of Triangle ABC = Area of Triangle CDA = ½ × Area of Parallelogram ABCD
   
4. **If diagonals AC and BD of quadrilateral ABCD bisect each other**, then ABCD is a parallelogram.

## Practice Exercises 💪

1. If diagonals of a quadrilateral bisect each other, prove that it is a parallelogram.
   
2. In a parallelogram ABCD, E is the midpoint of side BC. Prove that the area of triangle AED is one-fourth the area of the parallelogram.
   
3. Show that the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.

## Summary of Key Theorems 📝

1. **Parallelogram Theorem**: A quadrilateral is a parallelogram if and only if its opposite sides are parallel.
   
2. **Mid-point Theorem**: In a triangle, the line segment joining the midpoints of any two sides is parallel to the third side and equal to half of it.
   
3. **Rectangle Theorem**: A parallelogram is a rectangle if and only if its diagonals are equal.
   
4. **Rhombus Theorem**: A parallelogram is a rhombus if and only if its diagonals bisect each other at right angles.
   
5. **Square Theorem**: A parallelogram is a square if and only if its diagonals are equal and bisect each other at right angles.

## Conclusion 🎯

Quadrilaterals are essential shapes in geometry with applications ranging from construction and design to computer graphics and engineering. Understanding their properties helps us solve complex geometric problems and appreciate the mathematical structure behind the shapes we see in everyday life.

Remember that all quadrilaterals form a family, with the parallelogram as a parent shape having several special children—rectangles, rhombuses, and squares—each with its unique properties while inheriting the characteristics of its parent! This hierarchical relationship helps us organize our understanding of these fascinating four-sided wonders of geometry! ✨
