        explanation: "The volume of the cone is V = (1/3) × π × 5² × 12 = (1/3) × π × 25 × 12 = 100π cm³.\n\nWhen this cone is submerged, the water level will rise by h, where πr²h = 100π (r is the radius of the cylinder).\n\nSubstituting r = 6 cm:\nπ × 6² × h = 100π\n36π × h = 100π\nh = 100/36 = 25/9 ≈ 2.78 cm\n\nActually, I made an error.

Let's try a different approach.\n\nThe frustum has height 8 cm, the top radius is 1.6 cm (as calculated), and the bottom radius is 8 cm.\nUsing the formula for the volume of a frustum: V = (1/3) × π × h × (R² + Rr + r²), where R is the larger radius, r is the smaller radius, and h is the height.\n\nV = (1/3) × π × 8 × (8² + 8 × 1.6 + 1.6²)\nV = (1/3) × π × 8 × (64 + 12.8 + 2.56)\nV = (1/3) × π × 8 × 79.36\nV = (1/3) × π × 634.88\nV = 211.627π cm³\n\nThis is approximately 211.627π = 664.5π/3 cm³, which still doesn't match. Let me redo the whole calculation carefully.\n\nFor the large cone: V₁ = (1/3) × π × 8² × 10 = (1/3) × π × 64 × 10 = 640π/3 cm³\n\nFor the small cone: r₂ = 8 × (2/10) = 1.6 cm, V₂ = (1/3) × π × 1.6² × 2 = (1/3) × π × 2.56 × 2 = (1/3) × π × 5.12 = 5.12π/3 cm³\n\nVolume of the frustum = V₁ - V₂ = 640π/3 - 5.12π/3 = 634.88π/3 cm³\n\nThis still doesn't match any option exactly.
