    explanation: "Semi-perimeter s = (25 + 29 + 36) ÷ 2 = 45 cm. Area = √[45(45-25)(45-29)(45-36)] = √[45 × 20 × 16 × 9] = √129,600 = 359.76 cm²."

    question: "A quadrilateral plot has been divided into two triangles with areas 320 m² and 400 m². If the shared side of these triangles is 40 m, what is its length?",

      "18 m",
      "20 m",
      "22 m"

    correctOptionIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Using the base-height formula: area = ½ × base × height. For shared side 40 m: 320 = ½ × 40 × h₁ and 400 = ½ × 40 × h₂, giving h₁ = 16 m and h₂ = 20 m. Total height = 16 + 20 = 36 m. Using Heron's formula with the shared diagonal gives shared side = 18 m."

      "192 cm²",
      "96 cm²",

    correctOptionIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Maximum area occurs when the triangle is equilateral with side length 16 cm (48 ÷ 3). Using formula Area = (√3/4)a², we get Area = (√3/4) × 16² = (√3/4) × 256 = 64√3 ≈ 192 cm²."

      "120 cm²",
      "156 cm²",
      "130 cm²"

    correctOptionIndex: 1,
    explanation: "The rhombus can be divided into two triangles. Let the other diagonal be 2x. Using Pythagoras: 13² = 12² + x². So x = 5. Other diagonal = 2x = 10 cm. Area = (24 × 10) ÷ 2 = 120 cm². Same result using Heron's formula for the triangles."

      "42 units",
      "84 units",
      "126 units",
      "168 units"
    ],
    correctOptionIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Let sides be 13k, 14k, 15k. Using Heron's formula: 84 = √[21k(21k-13k)(21k-14k)(21k-15k)] = √[21k × 8k × 7k × 6k] = k² × √7056 = 84k², so k = 1. Perimeter = 13 + 14 + 15 = 42 units. But that's for area 42, so for area 84, perimeter = 84 units."

    question: "In a triangle ABC, if b² + c² = 5a², then what is sin A?",

      "1/√5",
      "2/√5",
      "1/5",
      "2/5"
    ],
    correctOptionIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Using the cosine formula: b² + c² = a² + 2bc·cosA. Given b² + c² = 5a², we have 5a² = a² + 2bc·cosA, so 4a² = 2bc·cosA, thus cosA = 2a²/(bc). By the sine formula: sinA = 2Area/(bc). Using Heron's formula and the constraint, we get sinA = 2/√5."

      "60 cm²",
      "24 cm²",
      "30 cm²"
    ],
    correctOptionIndex: 3,
    explanation: "When circles touch externally, the distance between centers equals the sum of their radii. So the triangle has sides (3+4) = 7 cm, (4+5) = 9 cm, and (3+5) = 8 cm. Using Heron's formula: s = 12, Area = √[12(12-7)(12-9)(12-8)] = √[12 × 5 × 3 × 4] = √720 = 30 cm²."

    explanation: "Perimeter of the park = 120 + 160 + 200 = 480 m. Cost of fencing = 480 × 25 = ₹12,000. (Note: Using Heron's formula gives the area as 9,600 m², but the question asks about fencing, which relates to perimeter.)"

    correctOptionIndex: 2,
    explanation: "If sides are in ratio 3:5:6, let sides be 3k, 5k, 6k. Semi-perimeter s = (3k + 5k + 6k) ÷ 2 = 7k. Using Heron's formula: 84 = √[7k × 4k × 2k × k] = k² × √56. Solving: k = 2, so perimeter = 3k + 5k + 6k = 14k = 14 × 4 = 56 cm."

    explanation: "Let the third side be x. Using Area = ½ × base × height and applying the Pythagorean theorem for height, we get a quadratic equation. Solving this equation: 54 = ½ × 12 × h, with h related to x through the Pythagorean theorem. This gives x = 9 or x = 21."

    correctOptionIndex: 0,
    explanation: "Each side of the rhombus = √[(8)² + (6)²] = √100 = 10 cm (using half-diagonals). Using Heron's formula: s = (10 + 10 + 10 + 10) ÷ 2 = 20. Since a rhombus has 4 equal sides forming 4 congruent triangles, area = 4 × √[5 × 5 × 5 × 5] = 4 × 25 = 100. Direct formula for rhombus: (16 × 12) ÷ 2 = 96 cm²."

      "6 cm",
      "18 cm"
    ],
    correctOptionIndex: 2,
    explanation: "For maximum area with two fixed sides a and b, the third side must be perpendicular to the other two (forming a right triangle). Using Pythagoras: x² = 8² + 10² = 64 + 100 = 164, so x = 12.8. This is incorrect because we need x < a + b. For fixed perimeter, maximum area occurs with x = 6 cm (found using calculus)."
