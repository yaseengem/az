        correctAnswer: "Bar graph",
        explanation: "A bar graph is ideal for comparing discrete quantities over different categories, like rainfall amounts across different months. Each month can be represented by a bar, with the height proportional to the rainfall amount, making it easy to compare precipitation across the year. üìä",

        correctAnswer: "360¬∞",
        explanation: "The angles in a pie chart always sum to 360¬∞ because a pie chart represents a complete circle, which has 360 degrees. Each slice represents a proportion of the whole, and together all slices must form the complete circle. üîÑ",

        correctAnswer: "The area of each bar is proportional to the frequency",
        explanation: "In a histogram, the area of each bar is proportional to the frequency of the data in that interval. This is an important property, especially when the class intervals have different widths. The height then represents the frequency density (frequency divided by class width). üìä",

        explanation: "A 'less than' ogive (cumulative frequency curve) is particularly useful for determining the median and other percentile values graphically.

            "A 'less than' ogive is used for discrete data while a 'more than' ogive is used for continuous data"
        ],
        correctAnswer: "A 'less than' ogive uses cumulative frequencies less than or equal to the upper limit of each class, while a 'more than' ogive uses cumulative frequencies more than or equal to the lower limit",
        explanation: "The key difference is in how cumulative frequencies are calculated. A 'less than' ogive plots cumulative frequencies up to the upper limit of each class interval, showing how many values are less than or equal to that point. A 'more than' ogive plots how many values are greater than or equal to the lower limit of each class. üìâ",
        wrongAnswerExplanations: {
            "A 'less than' ogive starts from the bottom left while a 'more than' ogive starts from the top left": "Both types of ogives can start at different points depending on the data; this isn't the defining difference.",
            "A 'less than' ogive is drawn with a solid line while a 'more than' ogive uses a dotted line": "The line style isn't what distinguishes these types of ogives.",
            "A 'less than' ogive is used for discrete data while a 'more than' ogive is used for continuous data": "Both types can be used for either discrete or continuous data."

        question: "If a company's quarterly profits are ‚Çπ5 lakh, ‚Çπ7 lakh, ‚Çπ6.5 lakh, and ‚Çπ8 lakh, which graph would best show how the profits changed throughout the year?",
        options: [
            "Pie chart",
            "Line graph",
            "Histogram",
            "Scatter plot"
        ],
        correctAnswer: "Line graph",
        explanation: "A line graph is the best choice for showing how a value changes over time. In this case, it would clearly show the trend of quarterly profits rising and falling throughout the year, making patterns and overall direction easy to identify. üìà",

            "Pie chart": "A pie chart would show the proportion of annual profit from each quarter, but not how profits changed over time.",
            "Histogram": "Histograms show frequency distributions, not changes over time.",
            "Scatter plot": "Scatter plots show relationships between two variables, not a single variable's change over time."
