# Linear Equations üìä

Linear equations are the building blocks of algebra and are used extensively in many real-world applications. In this topic, we'll explore linear equations in depth, focusing on their different forms, properties, and how to work with them effectively.

## Standard Forms of Linear Equations üìù

A linear equation in two variables can be written in several forms, each with its own advantages for different situations:

### 1. Standard Form: ax + by + c = 0

This is the most general form of a linear equation, where:
- a, b, and c are constants
- a and b cannot both be zero

**Example**: 3x + 4y - 12 = 0

The standard form is useful for identifying the coefficients of x and y, and is often used in systems of equations.

### 2. Slope-Intercept Form: y = mx + b

Where:
- m is the slope of the line
- b is the y-intercept (where the line crosses the y-axis)

**Example**: y = 2x + 3

This form is particularly useful because you can immediately identify:
- The slope of the line (m = 2)
- The y-intercept (b = 3)

### 3. Point-Slope Form: y - y‚ÇÅ = m(x - x‚ÇÅ)

Where:
- (x‚ÇÅ, y‚ÇÅ) is a point on the line
- m is the slope of the line

**Example**: y - 5 = 3(x - 2)

This form is useful when you know a point on the line and the slope. It's particularly handy when finding the equation of a line through a specific point.

### 4. Intercept Form: (x/a) + (y/b) = 1

Where:
- a is the x-intercept
- b is the y-intercept

**Example**: (x/6) + (y/3) = 1

This form is useful when you know the intercepts of the line with the x and y axes.

## Converting Between Different Forms üîÑ

Being able to convert between these forms is an essential skill:

### From Standard Form to Slope-Intercept Form

Start with the standard form: ax + by + c = 0
1. Isolate the y-term: by = -ax - c
2. Divide all terms by b: y = (-a/b)x - (c/b)

**Example**: Convert 3x + 2y - 6 = 0 to slope-intercept form
1. 2y = -3x + 6
2. y = (-3/2)x + 3

### From Slope-Intercept Form to Standard Form

Start with slope-intercept form: y = mx + b
1. Move all terms to one side: y - mx - b = 0
2. Rearrange if needed: mx - y + b = 0

**Example**: Convert y = 2x - 5 to standard form
1. y - 2x + 5 = 0
2. 2x - y - 5 = 0

### From Point-Slope Form to Slope-Intercept Form

Start with point-slope form: y - y‚ÇÅ = m(x - x‚ÇÅ)
1. Expand: y - y‚ÇÅ = mx - mx‚ÇÅ
2. Rearrange: y = mx + (y‚ÇÅ - mx‚ÇÅ)

**Example**: Convert y - 3 = 4(x - 2) to slope-intercept form
1. y - 3 = 4x - 8
2. y = 4x - 8 + 3 = 4x - 5

## Special Cases of Linear Equations üîç

### 1. Horizontal Lines: y = k

- Equation has the form y = k (a constant)
- The slope is 0
- The line is parallel to the x-axis
- **Example**: y = 5 (all points on this line have a y-coordinate of 5)

### 2. Vertical Lines: x = k

- Equation has the form x = k (a constant)
- The slope is undefined
- The line is parallel to the y-axis
- **Example**: x = -3 (all points on this line have an x-coordinate of -3)

### 3. Lines Through the Origin: ax + by = 0

- These lines pass through the origin (0, 0)
- They can be simplified to the form y = mx
- **Example**: 2x - 3y = 0, which simplifies to y = (2/3)x

## The Significance of Coefficients in Standard Form üßÆ

In the standard form ax + by + c = 0:

1. The coefficient a:
   - If a = 0, the line is horizontal (y = -c/b)
   - If a ‚â† 0, the x-intercept is -c/a

2. The coefficient b:
   - If b = 0, the line is vertical (x = -c/a)
   - If b ‚â† 0, the y-intercept is -c/b

3. The constant c:
   - If c = 0, the line passes through the origin
   - The intercepts are (-c/a, 0) and (0, -c/b)

## Graphical Representation of Linear Equations üìà

A linear equation in two variables represents a straight line in the coordinate plane. To graph a linear equation:

### Method 1: Using Intercepts

1. Find the x-intercept (set y = 0 and solve for x)
2. Find the y-intercept (set x = 0 and solve for y)
3. Plot these two points and draw a line through them

**Example**: Graph 2x + 3y = 6
- x-intercept: when y = 0, 2x = 6, so x = 3. Point (3, 0)
- y-intercept: when x = 0, 3y = 6, so y = 2. Point (0, 2)
- Draw a line through (3, 0) and (0, 2)

### Method 2: Using Slope-Intercept Form

1. Convert the equation to slope-intercept form (y = mx + b)
2. Plot the y-intercept (0, b)
3. Use the slope to find another point (rise over run)
4. Draw a line through these points

**Example**: Graph y = 2x - 3
- y-intercept is (0, -3)
- Using slope of 2: from (0, -3), move right 1 unit and up 2 units to get (1, -1)
- Draw a line through (0, -3) and (1, -1)

### Method 3: Using a Table of Values

1. Choose some values for x
2. Calculate the corresponding y-values
3. Plot the points
4. Draw a line through them

**Example**: Graph 3x - 2y = 6

| x | y |
|---|---|
| 0 | -3 |
| 2 | 0 |
| 4 | 3 |

Plot the points (0, -3), (2, 0), and (4, 3), then draw a line through them.

## The Slope of a Line üìê

The slope of a line is a measure of its steepness and direction. For a line passing through points (x‚ÇÅ, y‚ÇÅ) and (x‚ÇÇ, y‚ÇÇ):

Slope (m) = (y‚ÇÇ - y‚ÇÅ) / (x‚ÇÇ - x‚ÇÅ)

### Properties of Slope:

1. **Positive Slope**: The line rises from left to right
   Example: y = 2x + 1 (m = 2)

2. **Negative Slope**: The line falls from left to right
   Example: y = -3x + 4 (m = -3)

3. **Zero Slope**: The line is horizontal
   Example: y = 5 (m = 0)

4. **Undefined Slope**: The line is vertical
   Example: x = 3 (slope is undefined)

### Relationship Between Slopes of Lines:

1. **Parallel Lines**: Have the same slope
   If line 1 has slope m‚ÇÅ and line 2 has slope m‚ÇÇ, they are parallel if m‚ÇÅ = m‚ÇÇ

2. **Perpendicular Lines**: Have slopes that are negative reciprocals of each other
   If line 1 has slope m‚ÇÅ and line 2 has slope m‚ÇÇ, they are perpendicular if m‚ÇÅ √ó m‚ÇÇ = -1

## Applications of Linear Equations üåê

Linear equations have numerous real-world applications:

### 1. Distance, Speed, and Time Problems

**Example**: A train travels at 60 km/h and starts from a station. Another train traveling at 80 km/h starts 2 hours later from the same station. When will the second train catch up with the first?

Let t be the time (in hours) when the second train catches up.
- Distance traveled by first train: 60(t)
- Distance traveled by second train: 80(t - 2)
- When they meet: 60t = 80(t - 2)
- Solving: 60t = 80t - 160 ‚Üí -20t = -160 ‚Üí t = 8 hours

### 2. Mixture Problems

**Example**: How many liters of 30% acid solution should be mixed with 20 liters of 50% acid solution to get a 40% acid solution?

Let x be the volume (in liters) of 30% acid solution.
- Amount of acid in 30% solution: 0.3x
- Amount of acid in 50% solution: 0.5 √ó 20 = 10
- Amount of acid in final mixture: 0.4(x + 20)
- Setting up the equation: 0.3x + 10 = 0.4(x + 20)
- Solving: 0.3x + 10 = 0.4x + 8 ‚Üí 10 - 8 = 0.4x - 0.3x ‚Üí 2 = 0.1x ‚Üí x = 20 liters

### 3. Cost and Revenue Problems

**Example**: A company produces x units of a product. The cost function is C(x) = 200 + 5x and the revenue function is R(x) = 8x. Find the break-even point.

At the break-even point, cost equals revenue:
- C(x) = R(x)
- 200 + 5x = 8x
- 200 = 3x
- x = 200/3 ‚âà 66.7 units

### 4. Motion Problems

**Example**: Two cyclists start at the same point and travel in opposite directions. One travels at 15 km/h and the other at 12 km/h. After how many hours will they be 81 km apart?

Let t be the time in hours.
- Distance traveled by first cyclist: 15t
- Distance traveled by second cyclist: 12t
- Total distance between them: 15t + 12t = 27t
- When the distance is 81 km: 27t = 81
- Solving: t = 3 hours

## Sample Problems and Solutions üìù

### Problem 1: Finding the Equation of a Line

Find the equation of the line passing through the points (2, 3) and (5, 11).

**Solution**:
1. Calculate the slope: m = (11 - 3) / (5 - 2) = 8 / 3
2. Use point-slope form with (2, 3): y - 3 = (8/3)(x - 2)
3. Expand: y - 3 = (8/3)x - (16/3)
4. Rearrange to slope-intercept form: y = (8/3)x - (16/3) + 3 = (8/3)x - (7/3)
5. Convert to standard form: 8x - 3y - 7 = 0

### Problem 2: Finding the Point of Intersection

Find the point of intersection of the lines 2x - 3y = 6 and 4x + y = 16.

**Solution**:
1. From the second equation: y = 16 - 4x
2. Substitute into the first equation: 2x - 3(16 - 4x) = 6
3. Expand: 2x - 48 + 12x = 6
4. Combine like terms: 14x - 48 = 6
5. Solve for x: 14x = 54 ‚Üí x = 54/14 = 27/7
6. Substitute back: y = 16 - 4(27/7) = 16 - 108/7 = 112/7 - 108/7 = 4/7
7. The point of intersection is (27/7, 4/7)

### Problem 3: Determining the Nature of Lines

Determine if the lines 3x + 4y = 12 and 6x + 8y = 30 are parallel, perpendicular, or neither.

**Solution**:
1. Convert first equation to slope-intercept form: 3x + 4y = 12 ‚Üí 4y = -3x + 12 ‚Üí y = (-3/4)x + 3. Slope is -3/4.
2. Convert second equation to slope-intercept form: 6x + 8y = 30 ‚Üí 8y = -6x + 30 ‚Üí y = (-6/8)x + 30/8 = (-3/4)x + 15/4. Slope is -3/4.
3. Since the slopes are equal, the lines are parallel.
