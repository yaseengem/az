        correctAnswer: "To establish the truth of a mathematical statement with absolute certainty",
        explanation: "The primary purpose of a mathematical proof is to establish the truth of a mathematical statement with absolute certainty through logical deduction. Unlike scientific theories which may be revised with new evidence, a valid mathematical proof provides definitive verification within its axiomatic system.",

        ],
        correctAnswer: "It must include numerous examples to verify the pattern",
        explanation: "While examples can build intuition, a proof cannot rely on examples alone. This would be inductive reasoning, not deductive reasoning. A valid mathematical proof must establish the truth for all cases through logical deduction, not just verify a pattern with specific examples.",

        explanation: "A direct proof follows a straightforward approach: it starts with the given hypothesis or assumptions and proceeds through a sequence of logical steps, each following from the previous ones, until reaching the desired conclusion.

        correctAnswer: "Proof by counterexample",
        explanation: "To disprove a universal statement ('all...are...'), you only need to find one example where the statement fails. The number 2 is prime but even, making it a perfect counterexample that disproves the statement 'All prime numbers are odd.'",

        correctAnswer: "Prove the statement is true for n = 0 or n = 1 (the base case)",
        explanation: "Mathematical induction requires first establishing that the statement is true for a base case, typically n = 1 or sometimes n = 0. This serves as the foundation upon which the inductive argument builds. Only after proving the base case do you assume the statement for n = k and prove it for n = k + 1.",

        explanation: "In a proof by contradiction, we begin by assuming the opposite (negation) of what we want to prove. We then show that this assumption leads to a logical contradiction, which means our original assumption must be false and therefore what we wanted to prove must be true.",

        ],
        correctAnswer: "A proof that divides the problem into several exhaustive cases and proves each separately",
        explanation: "A proof by cases involves dividing the problem into several exhaustive scenarios (covering all possibilities) and then proving the statement separately for each case. When all cases have been proven, the original statement is established for all possible situations.",

        correctAnswer: "If the ground is not wet, then it is not raining",
        explanation: "The contrapositive of a statement 'if P, then Q' is 'if not Q, then not P'. For the statement 'If it is raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q)', the contrapositive is 'If the ground is not wet (not Q), then it is not raining (not P)'.

        ],
        correctAnswer: "Using what you're trying to prove as part of your argument",
        explanation: "Circular reasoning is a logical fallacy where the argument assumes what it's attempting to prove. In a circular proof, the conclusion is essentially embedded in the premises or reasoning steps, making the proof invalid because it doesn't actually establish the truth independently.",

        correctAnswer: "A theorem is the statement to be proven, while a proof is the logical argument establishing its truth",
        explanation: "A theorem is the mathematical statement or claim whose truth needs to be established. A proof is the logical sequence of arguments and steps that demonstrates why the theorem is true. In other words, the theorem is the 'what' and the proof is the 'why' and 'how'.",

        explanation: "Universal statements of the form 'All A are B' can be disproven with a single counterexample. The statement 'All even numbers are divisible by 4' is false because we can find a counterexample: 6 is an even number, but it's not divisible by 4.",

        correctAnswer: "The adherence to strict logical standards and precise reasoning",
        explanation: "Mathematical rigor refers to the strictness, accuracy, and precision in mathematical reasoning. A rigorous proof leaves no logical gaps, makes all assumptions explicit, uses precise definitions, and follows the rules of logical inference exactly.

        correctAnswer: "A proof that demonstrates a mathematical object with certain properties exists",
        explanation: "An existence proof specifically demonstrates that there exists at least one mathematical object (like a number, function, or set) that satisfies certain given properties or conditions. It doesn't necessarily find or construct all such objects, nor does it need to provide a specific exampleâthough constructive existence proofs do provide explicit examples.",

        correctAnswer: "It achieves the result with minimal steps and maximum insight",
        explanation: "In mathematics, an elegant proof is one that achieves its result in a surprisingly concise, clear, and insightful way. Elegance typically involves simplicity, depth of insight, unexpected connections, and a certain aesthetic quality that mathematicians value. An elegant proof often reveals the 'why' behind a result, not just the 'what'.",

        correctAnswer: "By proving a base case and showing that the truth for one number implies the truth for the next number",
        explanation: "Mathematical induction works like a chain reaction or falling dominoes. By proving that the statement is true for a starting value (base case, usually n=1) and then proving that if it's true for any number k, it must also be true for k+1, we establish that the statement is true for all positive integers starting from the base case.",

        correctAnswer: "Proof by popularity",

        correctAnswer: "They may be difficult to verify completely by human checking alone",
        explanation: "Computer-assisted proofs are sometimes controversial because they can involve calculations or case analyses too extensive for humans to verify completely by hand.

        explanation: "The key difference is the nature of their truth claims.
