        explanation: "In congruent triangles, corresponding angles are equal. Since ‚ñ≥ABC ‚âÖ ‚ñ≥DEF, angle B corresponds to angle E. Given that angle B = 60¬∞, angle E must also be 60¬∞.

        correctAnswer: "Determining the strength of a bridge truss",
        explanation: "Triangle congruence is used in structural engineering, particularly in bridge truss designs. The use of congruent triangles in trusses provides stability and distributes forces evenly. This principle is why triangular shapes are commonly used in construction for their rigidity and strength. üèóÔ∏è",

        correctAnswer: "Both length and angle measure",
        explanation: "Congruence preserves both length and angle measure. When two triangles are congruent, all their corresponding sides have equal lengths and all their corresponding angles have equal measures. This complete preservation of size and shape is what defines congruence. üìê",

            "Only length": "Congruence preserves both length and angle measure, not just length.",
            "Only angle measure": "Preserving only angle measure would result in similar triangles, not necessarily congruent ones.",
            "Neither length nor angle measure": "Congruence definitely preserves both length and angle measure."

        question: "If triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, and angle A = 45¬∞, side AB = 5 cm, which of the following must be true?",
        options: [
            "Angle D = 45¬∞ only",
            "Side DE = 5 cm only",
            "Both angle D = 45¬∞ and side DE = 5 cm",
            "Either angle D = 45¬∞ or side DE = 5 cm"
        ],
        correctAnswer: "Both angle D = 45¬∞ and side DE = 5 cm",
        explanation: "Since triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, all corresponding parts are equal. If angle A = 45¬∞ and side AB = 5 cm, then their corresponding parts in triangle DEF, which are angle D and side DE, must also be 45¬∞ and 5 cm respectively. This follows from the CPCTC principle. üîç",
