        question: "In triangles ABC and DEF, if AB = DE, ‚à†A = ‚à†D, and ‚à†B = ‚à†E, which congruence criterion proves they are congruent?",

        explanation: "Given that AB = DE, ‚à†A = ‚à†D, and ‚à†B = ‚à†E, we have two angles (A and B) and the included side (AB) equal to the corresponding parts in the other triangle. This matches the ASA (Angle-Side-Angle) criterion, which states that if two angles and the included side of one triangle equal the corresponding parts of another triangle, the triangles are congruent. üìê",

        correctAnswer: "No additional information is needed",
        explanation: "Given that ‚à†A = ‚à†P, ‚à†B = ‚à†Q, and AB = PQ, we already have enough information to establish congruence using the AAS (Angle-Angle-Side) criterion. Since two angles of a triangle determine the third (angles in a triangle sum to 180¬∞), we know ‚à†C = ‚à†R as well. With two pairs of angles equal and one pair of sides equal, the triangles are congruent by the AAS criterion. üîç",

        correctAnswer: "Rhombus",
        explanation: "If the diagonals of a quadrilateral bisect each other, the quadrilateral is a parallelogram. If, additionally, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, the parallelogram must be a rhombus. This can be proven using congruence criteria: In a parallelogram, if the diagonals intersect at right angles, the triangles formed by the diagonals and two adjacent sides are congruent, which establishes that all sides are equal, making it a rhombus. üî∑",
