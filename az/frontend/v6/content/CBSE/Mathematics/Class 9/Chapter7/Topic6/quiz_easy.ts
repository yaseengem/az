        correctAnswer: "The side opposite to the greater angle is longer",
        explanation: "In any triangle, if one angle is greater than another angle, then the side opposite to the greater angle is longer than the side opposite to the smaller angle. üìè",
        wrongAnswerExplanations: {
            "The triangle is isosceles": "Having unequal angles doesn't make a triangle isosceles. An isosceles triangle has two equal angles.",
            "The side opposite to the greater angle is shorter": "This is incorrect. The side opposite to the greater angle is longer, not shorter.",
            "The triangle is equilateral": "An equilateral triangle has all angles equal, which contradicts the premise of having unequal angles."

        question: "According to the converse of the midpoint theorem, if a line divides two sides of a triangle proportionally, then it is...",
        options: [
            "Perpendicular to the third side",
            "Passing through the third side's midpoint",
            "Parallel to the third side",
            "Equal in length to the third side"
        ],
        correctAnswer: "Parallel to the third side",
        explanation: "According to the converse of the midpoint theorem, if a line divides two sides of a triangle proportionally, then it is parallel to the third side. This is particularly true when the line divides the sides in the same ratio. üìê",
        wrongAnswerExplanations: {
            "Perpendicular to the third side": "The line would be parallel to the third side, not perpendicular.",
            "Passing through the third side's midpoint": "This is not necessarily true. The line is parallel to the third side but doesn't need to pass through its midpoint.",
            "Equal in length to the third side": "The length of the line depends on the proportional division of the two sides and is not necessarily equal to the third side."
