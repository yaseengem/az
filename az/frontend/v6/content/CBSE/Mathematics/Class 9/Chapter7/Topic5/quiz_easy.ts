        explanation: "In these right-angled triangles, PR and XZ are the hypotenuses (opposite to the right angles at Q and Y), and QR and YZ are corresponding legs.

This congruence criterion states that two triangles are congruent if two angles and a non-included side of one triangle are equal to the corresponding parts of another triangle.

        correctAnswer: "Because we know all three angles and one side",
        explanation: "The AAS criterion is valid because when we know two angles in a triangle, we automatically know the third angle (since angles in a triangle sum to 180¬∞). So, with AAS, we effectively know all three angles and one side. This ensures that the triangles are similar, and the equal side ensures they are the same size, making them congruent. üîç",

        correctAnswer: "They bisect each other at right angles",
        explanation: "In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. This can be proven using congruence criteria: when we consider the triangles formed by the diagonals, we can show that these triangles are congruent by the SSS criterion (all sides of a rhombus are equal). From this congruence, we can deduce that the diagonals not only bisect each other (as in all parallelograms) but do so at right angles. üìè",
        wrongAnswerExplanations: {
            "They are equal in length": "The diagonals of a rhombus are not necessarily equal in length.",
            "They form four congruent triangles": "While the diagonals do form congruent triangles, this is not a special property of rhombuses; it applies to parallelograms in general.",
            "They divide the rhombus into four equilateral triangles": "The triangles formed by the diagonals are not necessarily equilateral."

        question: "In triangles ABC and PQR, if ‚à†A = ‚à†P, ‚à†B = ‚à†Q, and ‚à†C = ‚à†R, what can we conclude?",
        options: [
            "The triangles are congruent",
            "The triangles are similar",
            "The triangles have the same area",
            "No definite conclusion can be drawn"
        ],
        correctAnswer: "The triangles are similar",
        explanation: "When all three angles of one triangle equal the corresponding angles of another triangle (AAA), the triangles are similar. This means they have the same shape but not necessarily the same size. For congruence, we would need at least one pair of corresponding sides to be equal, in addition to the equal angles. So, triangles ABC and PQR are similar, but we can't conclude they're congruent with just the given information. üìê",
        wrongAnswerExplanations: {
            "The triangles are congruent": "Equal angles only ensure similarity, not congruence; we need at least one pair of equal sides for congruence.",
            "The triangles have the same area": "Similar triangles don't necessarily have the same area; their areas are proportional to the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.",
            "No definite conclusion can be drawn": "We can definitely conclude that the triangles are similar based on the equal angles."

        question: "Which of the following is NOT a valid criterion for triangle congruence?",
        options: [
            "SSS (Side-Side-Side)",
            "SAS (Side-Angle-Side)",
            "SSA (Side-Side-Angle)",
            "ASA (Angle-Side-Angle)"
        ],
        correctAnswer: "SSA (Side-Side-Angle)",
        explanation: "SSA (Side-Side-Angle) is not generally a valid criterion for triangle congruence because it can lead to the 'ambiguous case' where two different triangles satisfy the same SSA conditions. Unlike SSS, SAS, and ASA, which uniquely determine a triangle, SSA can result in two possible triangles in some cases. There are special cases where SSA does guarantee congruence (like when the angle is a right angle), but it's not universally valid. ‚ö†Ô∏è",
        wrongAnswerExplanations: {
            "SSS (Side-Side-Side)": "SSS is a valid criterion; three equal sides guarantee congruence.",
            "SAS (Side-Angle-Side)": "SAS is a valid criterion; two sides and the included angle guarantee congruence.",
            "ASA (Angle-Side-Angle)": "ASA is a valid criterion; two angles and the included side guarantee congruence."

        options: [
            "The midpoint of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equidistant from all three vertices",
            "The midpoints of any two sides of a triangle determine a line parallel to the third side",

            "The midpoint of a triangle is always at the centroid"
        ],
        correctAnswer: "The line joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length",
        explanation: "The Middle-Point Theorem (also called the midsegment theorem) states that the line joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and equals half its length. For example, if D and E are the midpoints of sides AB and AC of triangle ABC, then DE is parallel to BC and DE = BC/2. This theorem can be proved using similar triangles or the properties of parallelograms. üìä",
