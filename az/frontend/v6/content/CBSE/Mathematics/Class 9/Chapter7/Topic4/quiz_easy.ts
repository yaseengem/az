        question: "If the angles of a triangle are in the ratio 2:3:4, what are the angles?",
        options: ["20¬∞, 30¬∞, 40¬∞", "40¬∞, 60¬∞, 80¬∞", "30¬∞, 45¬∞, 60¬∞", "20¬∞, 60¬∞, 100¬∞"],
        correctAnswer: "40¬∞, 60¬∞, 80¬∞",
        explanation: "If the angles are in the ratio 2:3:4, then we can write them as 2x, 3x, and 4x. Since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180¬∞, we have 2x + 3x + 4x = 180¬∞, which gives 9x = 180¬∞, so x = 20¬∞. Therefore, the angles are 2(20¬∞) = 40¬∞, 3(20¬∞) = 60¬∞, and 4(20¬∞) = 80¬∞. üßÆ",

            "30¬∞, 45¬∞, 60¬∞": "These angles don't follow the ratio 2:3:4, and their sum is only 135¬∞, not 180¬∞.",
