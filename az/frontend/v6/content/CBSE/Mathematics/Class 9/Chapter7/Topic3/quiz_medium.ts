        correctAnswer: "The angle bisector from the apex is also the perpendicular bisector of the base",
        explanation: "In an isosceles triangle, the angle bisector from the apex (the vertex where the two equal sides meet) to the base is also the perpendicular bisector of the base. This can be proven using the SAS congruence criterion: the two equal sides, the equal angles created by the angle bisector, and the fact that the angle bisector creates congruent triangles implies it must also be the perpendicular bisector of the base. üìè",

        question: "In a right-angled isosceles triangle, which congruence criterion requires the minimum number of measurements to establish congruence with another right-angled isosceles triangle?",
        options: [
            "One side",
            "Two sides",

        ],
        correctAnswer: "One side",
        explanation: "For right-angled isosceles triangles, knowing just one side is sufficient to establish congruence. Since the triangle is right-angled, one angle is 90¬∞. Since it's isosceles, two sides are equal, and two angles (other than the right angle) are equal (both 45¬∞). Given these constraints, one side measurement uniquely determines the triangle, making all right-angled isosceles triangles with the same side length congruent. üìä",
        wrongAnswerExplanations: {
            "Two sides": "While two sides would be sufficient, one side is actually enough given the constraints.",

        ],
        correctAnswer: "Two angles: 30¬∞, 60¬∞ and the non-included side: 10 cm",
        explanation: "The option 'Two angles: 30¬∞, 60¬∞ and the non - included side: 10 cm' would not uniquely determine a triangle. While this information falls under the AAS criterion, the side length given must correspond to a specific side of the triangle. If we don't specify which side the 10 cm corresponds to (such as the side opposite to the 30¬∞ angle or the side opposite to the 60¬∞ angle), multiple non-congruent triangles could satisfy these conditions. üîç",

However, the other angles (‚à†BAC = 30¬∞ and ‚à†EDF = 45¬∞) are different, which means the triangles cannot be congruent.
