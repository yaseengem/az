    correctAnswer: '4 cm',
    explanation: 'First, find the radius: r¬≤ = 3¬≤ + 4¬≤ = 9 + 16 = 25, so r = 5 cm. For the 6 cm chord: d = ‚àö(r¬≤ - (c/2)¬≤) = ‚àö(25 - 9) = ‚àö16 = 4 cm. This demonstrates how to find distances between chord and center. üßÆ',
    wrongAnswerExplanations: {
      '4.5 cm': 'This is an incorrect value that doesn\'t satisfy the relationship between chord length and distance from center.',
      '5 cm': 'This equals the radius, which would make the chord a tangent with zero length, not 6 cm.',
      '6 cm': 'This exceeds the radius, which is impossible for a chord inside the circle.'
