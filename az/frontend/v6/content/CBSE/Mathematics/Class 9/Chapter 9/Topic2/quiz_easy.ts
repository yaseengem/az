    correctAnswer: "It bisects the chord",
    explanation: "When a perpendicular is drawn from the center of a circle to a chord, it bisects the chord. This is a fundamental property in circle geometry that helps us find chord lengths and distances. üìè",

      "It makes an angle of 45¬∞ with the chord": "The perpendicular makes a 90¬∞ angle with the chord by definition, not 45¬∞.",
      "It is equal to the radius": "The length of the perpendicular is not necessarily equal to the radius. It equals the radius only if the chord passes through the center.",
      "None of the above": "The perpendicular from the center to a chord does bisect the chord, so this option is incorrect."
