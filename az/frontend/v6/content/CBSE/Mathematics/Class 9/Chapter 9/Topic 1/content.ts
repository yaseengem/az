# Angle Subtended by a Chord at a Point 🔵

## Introduction 🌟

Welcome to the fascinating world of circle geometry! 📐 In this topic, we'll explore one of the fundamental concepts in the study of circles: angles subtended by chords at different points. This concept forms the foundation for many important theorems and has numerous practical applications in engineering, architecture, and physics.

## What is an Angle Subtended by a Chord? 🤔

Let's start with some basic definitions:

- **Circle**: A circle is the set of all points in a plane that are at a fixed distance (called the radius) from a fixed point (called the center).
- **Chord**: A chord is a straight line segment whose endpoints both lie on the circle.
- **Subtended Angle**: When we say a chord "subtends" an angle at a point, we mean the angle formed at that point by the two lines connecting that point to the endpoints of the chord.

Imagine a chord AB in a circle. This chord can subtend angles at different points:
1. At the center of the circle (point O)
2. At any point on the circumference of the circle
3. At any point inside or outside the circle

## Angles Subtended at the Center and on the Circumference 📏

### Theorem 1: Angle at the Center and Angle at the Circumference 🌈

**Statement**: The angle subtended by an arc (or chord) at the center of a circle is twice the angle subtended by the same arc (or chord) at any point on the circumference.

Mathematically, if O is the center of the circle, and P is any point on the circumference, then:
- Angle subtended by chord AB at center O = 2 × Angle subtended by chord AB at point P on the circumference

**Proof**:
Let's consider a circle with center O, and points A and B on the circumference forming a chord AB.
Let P be any point on the circumference of the circle.
We need to prove that ∠AOB = 2 × ∠APB.

1. Draw radii OA and OB.
2. Consider the triangle OAP:
   - Since OA and OP are radii, they are equal in length.
   - So, OAP is an isosceles triangle.
   - Therefore, ∠OAP = ∠OPA (angles opposite to equal sides).
3. Similarly, in triangle OBP:
   - OB and OP are radii and equal in length.
   - So, OBP is an isosceles triangle.
   - Therefore, ∠OBP = ∠OPB.
4. Now, ∠AOB = ∠AOB (external angle of triangle OAP) = ∠OAP + ∠OPA = 2 × ∠OAP.
5. Similarly, ∠BOC (external angle of triangle OBP) = ∠OBP + ∠OPB = 2 × ∠OBP.
6. Therefore, ∠AOB = 2 × ∠APB.

**Visual Interpretation**: 
Imagine a pizza 🍕 where the center O represents the center of the pizza. If you draw a slice by making an angle at the center, and then look at that same slice from any point on the circumference of the pizza, the angle you see will be exactly half of the central angle.

### Example 1:
If a chord AB subtends an angle of 70° at the center O of a circle, what angle does it subtend at any point P on the circumference of the circle?

**Solution**:
Using Theorem 1, Angle at point P = Angle at center O ÷ 2 = 70° ÷ 2 = 35°

### Example 2:
If a chord AB subtends an angle of 40° at a point P on the circumference of a circle, what angle does it subtend at the center O?

**Solution**:
Using Theorem 1, Angle at center O = 2 × Angle at point P = 2 × 40° = 80°

## Angles in the Same Segment 🔄

### Theorem 2: Angles in the Same Segment 🌟

**Statement**: Angles subtended by the same arc (or chord) at any point on the same segment of a circle are equal.

In other words, if P and Q are two points on the same segment of a circle, and A and B are the endpoints of a chord, then:
- ∠APB = ∠AQB

**Proof**:
1. Let O be the center of the circle.
2. We know that ∠APB = ∠AOB ÷ 2 and ∠AQB = ∠AOB ÷ 2 (from Theorem 1).
3. Therefore, ∠APB = ∠AQB.

**Practical Application**: 
This property is used in the design of concert halls and stadiums 🏟️. If you place performers at one point on the circumference and design seating along an arc, all audience members along that arc will have the same viewing angle!

### Example 3:
In a circle, chord AB subtends an angle of 50° at point P on the circumference. What angle does it subtend at another point Q on the same side of AB?

**Solution**:
Since angles in the same segment are equal, ∠AQB = ∠APB = 50°

## Angles in a Semicircle ⚪

### Theorem 3: Angle in a Semicircle 📐

**Statement**: The angle subtended by a diameter at any point on the semicircle is a right angle (90°).

**Proof**:
1. Let AB be a diameter of the circle with center O.
2. Let P be any point on the semicircle.
3. Using Theorem 1, ∠APB = ∠AOB ÷ 2 = 180° ÷ 2 = 90°

This theorem is often called "Thales' Theorem" after the ancient Greek mathematician Thales.

**Practical Application**: 
This property is used in construction and surveying to create right angles. If you want to ensure that three points form a right angle, place them on a semicircle! 🏗️

### Example 4:
Three points A, B, and C lie on a circle. If AB is a diameter, what is the measure of ∠ACB?

**Solution**:
Since AB is a diameter, ∠ACB = 90° (angle in a semicircle)

## Angles in a Cyclic Quadrilateral 🔶

### Theorem 4: Opposite Angles in a Cyclic Quadrilateral 🔄

**Statement**: The opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral are supplementary (add up to 180°).

If ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral, then:
- ∠A + ∠C = 180°
- ∠B + ∠D = 180°

**Proof**:
The proof follows from applying Theorem 1 to the various angles in the quadrilateral.

**Practical Application**: 
This property is used in designing solar trackers that follow the sun's path throughout the day. ☀️

### Example 5:
In a cyclic quadrilateral PQRS, if ∠P = 70° and ∠R = 110°, find ∠Q and ∠S.

**Solution**:
Since opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral are supplementary:
∠P + ∠R = 180° (confirmed: 70° + 110° = 180°)
∠Q + ∠S = 180°

Let's say ∠Q = x. Then ∠S = 180° - x.

To find a unique solution, we'd need additional information. However, based on the given information, we know that ∠Q + ∠S = 180°.

## Problem-Solving Strategies 🎯

When tackling problems related to angles subtended by chords, follow these steps:

1. Identify the key elements: the chord, the point at which the angle is subtended, and the center of the circle.
2. Remember the fundamental relationship: the angle at the center is twice the angle at the circumference.
3. Consider whether the angles are in the same segment or opposite segments.
4. For cyclic quadrilaterals, use the property that opposite angles are supplementary.

## Real-world Applications 🌎

1. **Architecture**: Circular arches and domes in buildings apply the principles of angles in circles.
2. **Optics**: Reflection and refraction of light follow principles based on angles.
3. **Astronomy**: Measuring angular distances between celestial bodies.
4. **Engineering**: Designing circular components like gears and wheels.
5. **Navigation**: Using angles to determine position and direction.

## Summary ✨

## Additional Examples and Practice Questions

1. **Example**: If a chord subtends an angle of 120° at the center of a circle, what angle does it subtend at a point on the major arc of the circle?
   **Solution**: Angle subtended at a point on the circumference = Angle at center ÷ 2 = 120° ÷ 2 = 60°

2. **Example**: Two chords AB and CD intersect at point P inside a circle. If ∠APB = 65° and ∠CPD = 45°, find ∠ACB.
   **Solution**: When two chords intersect, the angle between them equals half the sum of the intercepted arcs. Using this property, we can calculate ∠ACB = 55°.

3. **Question**: If an angle subtended by a chord at the center is 80°, what is the angle subtended by the same chord at a point on the minor arc?
   **Answer**: 40° (half of the angle at the center)

4. **Question**: In a circle, a chord AB subtends an angle of 50° at point P and an angle of 130° at point Q. Are points P and Q on the same side of chord AB?
   **Answer**: No, they are on opposite sides of the chord. If they were on the same side, the angles would be equal.
