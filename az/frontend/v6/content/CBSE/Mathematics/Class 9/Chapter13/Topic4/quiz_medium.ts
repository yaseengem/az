        ],
        correctAnswer: "In any consistent formal system powerful enough to describe arithmetic, there exist statements that can neither be proven nor disproven within the system",
        explanation: "Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems showed that in any consistent formal system powerful enough to express basic arithmetic, there will always be statements that are true but cannot be proven within that system. This revolutionary result demonstrated fundamental limitations of formal mathematical systems and showed that no complete axiomatization of mathematics is possible.",

        correctAnswer: "They accept Euclid's first four postulates but replace the parallel postulate",
        explanation: "Non-Euclidean geometries (like hyperbolic and elliptic geometry) keep Euclid's first four postulates intact but replace the fifth postulate (the parallel postulate) with an alternative. For example, hyperbolic geometry allows infinitely many lines through a point parallel to a given line, while elliptic geometry allows no such parallels.",

        explanation: "Conjectures play a crucial role in driving mathematical progress by pointing to potential patterns or relationships.

        correctAnswer: "It connected previously separate branches of mathematics and used advanced techniques developed centuries after Fermat",
        explanation: "Andrew Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem was remarkable because it connected several previously distinct areas of mathematics, particularly number theory and algebraic geometry. The proof used mathematical techniques and concepts (like elliptic curves and modular forms) that weren't developed until centuries after Fermat's time, suggesting Fermat couldn't have had the complete proof he claimed.",

        correctAnswer: "Elegant mathematics often reveals deeper connections and structures that lead to further insights",
        explanation: "Mathematical elegance isn't just about aesthetic appeal—it often points to deeper mathematical structures and connections. Elegant proofs typically reveal why a result is true, not just that it's true.

        correctAnswer: "They are logically equivalent (each can be proven from the other)",
        explanation: "The Axiom of Choice and the Well-Ordering Theorem are logically equivalent—each can be derived from the other. The Axiom of Choice states that for any collection of non-empty sets, there exists a function that selects one element from each set. The Well-Ordering Theorem states that any set can be well-ordered (arranged so every non-empty subset has a least element). Ernst Zermelo showed that these powerful statements are equivalent, despite appearing quite different.",

        ],
        correctAnswer: "It sought to prove the consistency of mathematics using only finite methods",
        explanation: "Hilbert's program, formulated in the early 20th century, aimed to formalize all of mathematics based on a finite, complete set of axioms and then prove that this axiomatic system was both consistent (free from contradictions) and complete (able to prove or disprove any mathematical statement). Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems later showed that this ambitious program could not be fully realized.",

        ],
        correctAnswer: "It is provably undecidable within standard set theory (ZFC)",
        explanation: "The Continuum Hypothesis (CH) states there is no set whose size is strictly between that of the integers and the real numbers. Kurt Gödel and Paul Cohen proved that CH is independent of ZFC (standard set theory)—it can neither be proven nor disproven using those axioms. This makes it a statement that can be added as an axiom or its negation can be added, creating different consistent mathematical systems.",

            "Lemmas are always simpler to understand than theorems",
            "Lemmas serve as tools to prove theorems, while theorems represent more significant or stand-alone results",

        ],
        correctAnswer: "Lemmas serve as tools to prove theorems, while theorems represent more significant or stand-alone results",
        explanation: "The key difference between lemmas and theorems is their purpose, not their difficulty or structure. Lemmas are proven results primarily used as stepping stones to establish more significant theorems. Theorems, on the other hand, are typically considered important, stand-alone results. The distinction is somewhat subjective—what's considered a lemma in one context might be important enough to be called a theorem in another.",

        ],
        correctAnswer: "Different consistent mathematical systems can be built by choosing different axioms",
        explanation: "The discovery that the parallel postulate is independent of Euclid's other axioms—meaning it can be replaced with alternatives without creating contradictions—demonstrated that different, equally valid geometries can exist based on different choices of axioms. This led to non-Euclidean geometries and the broader understanding that mathematics isn't about discovering 'the one true system' but rather exploring the consequences of various consistent axiom systems.",

        ],
        correctAnswer: "Its truth would give insights into the distribution of prime numbers",
        explanation: "The Riemann Hypothesis is considered critically important because, if proven true, it would provide profound insights into the distribution of prime numbers, one of the most fundamental sequences in mathematics. Its resolution would have far-reaching implications for number theory and related fields. It's one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems, with a $1 million reward for its solution, reflecting its significance in mathematics.",

        correctAnswer: "It can be proven using only elementary methods",
        explanation: "A well-formulated conjecture doesn't need to be provable using only elementary methods—in fact, many important conjectures require developing sophisticated new techniques for their resolution. The other characteristics—precision, supporting evidence, and connection to existing theories—are indeed hallmarks of well-formulated conjectures.",

        correctAnswer: "They demonstrated that multiple, equally valid mathematical systems can exist based on different axioms",
        explanation: "The development of non-Euclidean geometries revolutionized mathematical thinking by showing that different, consistent mathematical systems can arise from different axiom choices. This challenged the view that mathematics discovers absolute truths about a single mathematical reality, replacing it with a more pluralistic conception where mathematics explores the consequences of various axiom systems.

        explanation: "Mathematical Platonism is the philosophical position that mathematical objects (like numbers, functions, and sets) and mathematical truths exist independently of human minds and human construction—they are discovered, not invented. This view contrasts with formalism (which sees mathematics as manipulation of meaningless symbols), constructivism (which requires explicit construction of mathematical objects), and intuitionism (which bases mathematics on mental constructions).",

        explanation: "Russell's Paradox (about whether the 'set of all sets that don't contain themselves' contains itself) revealed that naive set theory, which allowed unrestricted set formation, leads to contradictions.
