        correctAnswer: "A logical structure where the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises",
        explanation: "Validity in deductive reasoning concerns only the logical structure‚Äîwhether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. A valid argument can have false premises and still be valid, though not sound. üß©",

            "True premises": "Validity concerns structure, not the truth of premises; that's soundness.",
            "A conclusion that can be verified by observation": "Deductive validity is about logical necessity, not empirical verification.",
            "Premises that are accepted by most people": "Validity is about logical structure, not popular acceptance."
