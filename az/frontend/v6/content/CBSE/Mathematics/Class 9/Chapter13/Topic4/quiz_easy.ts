        options: [

        correctAnswer: "Provability (every axiom should be provable)",

        correctAnswer: "By finding a single counterexample",
        explanation: "A conjecture can be disproven by finding just one counterexample that violates the statement. This is because mathematical statements typically claim universality—they claim to be true for all cases within their specified domain.",

        ],
        correctAnswer: "A theorem has been proven while a conjecture has not",
        explanation: "The key distinction between a theorem and a conjecture is that a theorem has been rigorously proven through logical deduction, while a conjecture is a statement believed to be true based on evidence but still lacking a complete proof.",

        correctAnswer: "A conjecture",
        explanation: "Despite its name, before Andrew Wiles provided a proof in 1994, Fermat's Last Theorem was actually a conjecture—a statement believed to be true but lacking a complete proof. It was one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics for over 350 years.",

        ],
        correctAnswer: "Formulation as a conjecture",
        explanation: "When a mathematical pattern is observed, the next step is typically to formalize it as a conjecture—a precise mathematical statement that appears to be true based on the observed pattern but still needs proof. After that come testing, proof attempts, and eventually resolution (either as a theorem or disproven).",

        correctAnswer: "All triangles have angles that sum to 180 degrees",

        explanation: "If an axiom leads to contradiction, the system is inconsistent. In standard logic, such a system is problematic as any statement could be both true and false.",
