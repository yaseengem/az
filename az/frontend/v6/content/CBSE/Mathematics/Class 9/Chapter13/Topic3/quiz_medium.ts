        question: "Which proof technique is being used here? \"We want to prove that the square root of 2 is irrational. Assume ‚àö2 is rational. Then ‚àö2 = a/b where a and b are integers with no common factors. Squaring both sides: 2 = a¬≤/b¬≤, so a¬≤ = 2b¬≤. Therefore, a¬≤ is even, which means a is even. If a = 2k, then 2b¬≤ = 4k¬≤, so b¬≤ = 2k¬≤, making b even also. But this contradicts our assumption that a and b have no common factors. Therefore, ‚àö2 must be irrational.\"",

        explanation: "This proof assumes the opposite of what we want to prove (that ‚àö2 is rational), then shows this leads to a logical contradiction. Since the assumption leads to an impossibility, the original statement must be true. ‚àö2 is irrational. ‚ÜØ",
