        correctAnswer: "A disjunction",
        explanation: "A disjunction is a compound statement of the form \"p or q\". The given statement \"Either x > 5 or x < 3\" has the form \"p or q\" and is thus a disjunction. üîÄ",

        correctAnswer: "p ‚Üí q only",
        explanation: "A square always has four equal sides, so \"If the shape is a square, then it has four equal sides\" (p ‚Üí q) is true. However, a rhombus also has four equal sides but isn't a square, so \"If the shape has four equal sides, then it is a square\" (q ‚Üí p) is false. üü¶",
        wrongAnswerExplanations: {
            "q ‚Üí p only": "Having four equal sides is not sufficient to ensure a shape is a square (e.g., a rhombus).",
            "Both p ‚Üí q and q ‚Üí p": "Only p ‚Üí q is true, not q ‚Üí p.",
            "Neither p ‚Üí q nor q ‚Üí p": "The statement p ‚Üí q is true."

        correctAnswer: "x¬≤ - 3x + 2 = 0",
        explanation: "An open statement (predicate) contains variables and has no definite truth value until values are assigned to those variables. The equation \"x¬≤ - 3x + 2 = 0\" is true for x = 1 or x = 2, and false for other values of x. üß©",
