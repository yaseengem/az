# Mathematically Acceptable Statements 📝

After exploring what mathematical proofs are and why they're important, we now need to understand what kinds of statements we can actually prove. Not all statements are suitable for mathematical proof! In this topic, we'll dive into mathematically acceptable statements – the building blocks of mathematical reasoning. Let's explore what makes a statement "mathematical" and how to work with different types of mathematical statements. 🧩

## What Makes a Statement "Mathematical"? 🤔

A **mathematical statement** is a declarative sentence that is either true or false, but not both. These statements are the fundamental units of mathematical reasoning and proof.

### Characteristics of Mathematical Statements 📋

For a statement to be mathematically acceptable, it should:

1. **Be precise and unambiguous**: The statement must have a clear, exact meaning with no room for interpretation.
2. **Have a definite truth value**: The statement must be either true or false (even if we don't yet know which).
3. **Use well-defined terms**: All terms in the statement must have established, clear definitions.
4. **Be testable**: There must be a logical way to determine the statement's truth value.

### Examples of Mathematical Statements ✓

- "The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees."
- "2 + 3 = 5"
- "Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers." (This is the famous Goldbach's Conjecture, not yet proven but still a mathematical statement)
- "There are infinitely many prime numbers."

### Non-Examples (Not Mathematical Statements) ✗

- "Mathematics is beautiful." (Subjective opinion, not true or false)
- "Solve for x: x² = 9" (This is an instruction, not a statement)
- "x > 5" (This is not a statement unless x is specified; it's an open sentence)
- "This statement is false." (Paradoxical statement that cannot be assigned a truth value)

## Types of Mathematical Statements 🔄

Mathematical statements come in various forms, each playing a specific role in mathematical reasoning:

### 1. Simple Statements 🔹

Basic declarations that don't contain logical connectives.

**Examples**:
- "7 is a prime number."
- "A square has four equal sides."

### 2. Compound Statements 🔗

Statements formed by combining simple statements using logical connectives.

**Logical Connectives**:

| Symbol | Name | Meaning | Example |
|--------|------|---------|---------|
| ∧ | Conjunction (AND) | Both statements must be true | "x > 3 AND x < 7" |
| ∨ | Disjunction (OR) | At least one statement must be true | "x < 0 OR x > 5" |
| ¬ | Negation (NOT) | The statement is not true | "x is NOT divisible by 2" |
| → | Implication (IF...THEN) | If the first is true, then the second is true | "IF n is even, THEN n² is even" |
| ↔ | Biconditional (IF AND ONLY IF) | Both statements have the same truth value | "A triangle is equilateral IF AND ONLY IF all its angles are equal" |

### 3. Conditional Statements (If-Then Statements) 🔁

These have the form "If P, then Q" (P → Q), where:
- P is the **hypothesis** (or antecedent)
- Q is the **conclusion** (or consequent)

**Example**: "If a triangle is equilateral, then all its angles are equal."
- Hypothesis: A triangle is equilateral.
- Conclusion: All its angles are equal.

#### Related Forms of a Conditional Statement:

1. **Converse**: "If Q, then P" (Q → P)
   - Example: "If all angles of a triangle are equal, then the triangle is equilateral."

2. **Contrapositive**: "If not Q, then not P" (¬Q → ¬P)
   - Example: "If not all angles of a triangle are equal, then the triangle is not equilateral."

3. **Inverse**: "If not P, then not Q" (¬P → ¬Q)
   - Example: "If a triangle is not equilateral, then not all its angles are equal."

Important note: A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent (both true or both false). The converse and inverse are also logically equivalent to each other, but not necessarily to the original statement.

### 4. Universal and Existential Statements 🌍

1. **Universal Statements**: Make claims about all elements in a set.
   - Use quantifiers like "for all," "for every," "for any," "all"
   - Example: "For all integers n, n² ≥ n"

2. **Existential Statements**: Claim the existence of at least one element with a certain property.
   - Use quantifiers like "there exists," "for some," "there is at least one"
   - Example: "There exists a prime number greater than 100"

## Truth Tables: Analyzing Compound Statements 📊

Truth tables help us understand the truth value of compound statements based on the truth values of their components:

### AND (∧) Truth Table

| P | Q | P ∧ Q |
|---|---|-------|
| T | T | T     |
| T | F | F     |
| F | T | F     |
| F | F | F     |

A conjunction is true only when both components are true.

### OR (∨) Truth Table

| P | Q | P ∨ Q |
|---|---|-------|
| T | T | T     |
| T | F | T     |
| F | T | T     |
| F | F | F     |

A disjunction is true when at least one component is true.

### NOT (¬) Truth Table

| P | ¬P |
|---|-----|
| T | F   |
| F | T   |

Negation reverses the truth value.

### Implication (→) Truth Table

| P | Q | P → Q |
|---|---|-------|
| T | T | T     |
| T | F | F     |
| F | T | T     |
| F | F | T     |

An implication is false only when the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false.

## Negating Mathematical Statements 🔄

Negation is a crucial skill for proving statements by contradiction. Here's how to negate different types of statements:

1. **Simple Statement**: Add or remove "not"
   - Statement: "7 is prime"
   - Negation: "7 is not prime"

2. **AND Statement**: Negate each part and change AND to OR
   - Statement: "n is even AND n > 10"
   - Negation: "n is not even OR n ≤ 10"

3. **OR Statement**: Negate each part and change OR to AND
   - Statement: "x < 0 OR x > 5"
   - Negation: "x ≥ 0 AND x ≤ 5"

4. **Implication**: Change to AND and negate the conclusion
   - Statement: "If n is even, then n² is even"
   - Negation: "n is even AND n² is not even"

5. **Universal Statement**: Change to existential and negate the condition
   - Statement: "For all integers n, n² ≥ n"
   - Negation: "There exists an integer n such that n² < n"

6. **Existential Statement**: Change to universal and negate the condition
   - Statement: "There exists a prime number greater than 100"
   - Negation: "For all numbers greater than 100, none are prime"

## Open Sentences vs. Statements 📖

An **open sentence** contains variables and becomes a statement only when values are assigned to the variables.

- Open sentence: "x + 5 = 10"
  - This becomes true when x = 5, false for all other values of x

- Open sentence: "x² + y² = 25"
  - This becomes true for any (x,y) pair on the circle with radius 5, such as (3,4), (5,0), etc.

## Analyzing Mathematical Statements in Proofs 🔍

When working with mathematical statements in proofs:

1. **Identify the type of statement**: Is it conditional, universal, existential, etc.?

2. **Clarify the hypothesis and conclusion**: For conditional statements, clearly separate the "if" part from the "then" part.

3. **Determine the appropriate proof technique**:
   - For direct proofs: Start with the hypothesis and work toward the conclusion
   - For contradiction: Negate the conclusion and show it leads to a contradiction
   - For contrapositive: Prove "If not Q, then not P" instead of "If P, then Q"

4. **Check for quantifiers**: Universal statements often require proving for all cases or using induction, while existential statements require finding at least one example.

## Common Errors in Working with Mathematical Statements ⚠️

1. **Confusing a statement with its converse**: "If P, then Q" does NOT necessarily mean "If Q, then P"
   Example: "If a number is divisible by 4, then it's even" is true, but "If a number is even, then it's divisible by 4" is false.

2. **Assuming a statement is false just because it hasn't been proven**: Until proven or disproven, a statement's truth value is unknown, not false.

3. **Mistaking open sentences for statements**: "x² = 4" is not a statement until x is specified.

4. **Improper negation**: Especially with quantifiers and compound statements.

5. **Using undefined or ambiguous terms**: All terms in mathematical statements must be clearly defined.

## Importance in Mathematical Reasoning 🧠

Understanding mathematically acceptable statements is crucial because:

1. They form the building blocks of all mathematical proofs
2. They allow precise communication of mathematical ideas
3. They enable us to apply logical rules consistently
4. They help distinguish between what can and cannot be proven mathematically
