            "0.11111..."
        ],
        correctAnswer: "0.0909...",
        explanation: "1/11 = 0.0909... (with 09 repeating). When we divide 1 by 11, we get a repeating pattern of 09. This is a non-terminating repeating decimal because 11 has factors other than 2 and 5. This can also be written as 0.0ÃÖ9ÃÖ with a bar over both digits to indicate the repeating pattern. üîÑ",

        ],
        correctAnswer: "3/20",
        explanation: "3/20 has a terminating decimal expansion because 20 = 2¬≤√ó5, so its prime factorization only contains 2 and 5. When we divide 3 by 20, we get 0.15, which terminates. A fraction p/q (in lowest form) has a terminating decimal if and only if the prime factorization of q contains only factors of 2 and 5. ‚ûó",

        correctAnswer: "Doesn't exist",
        explanation: "A number cannot be both rational and irrational. By definition, these are mutually exclusive categories that together make up all real numbers. Every real number is either rational (can be expressed as a ratio of integers) or irrational (cannot be expressed as a ratio of integers), but never both. This is a fundamental classification of real numbers. üß†",

        options: [
            "Terminating decimal",
            "Non-terminating repeating decimal",

        correctAnswer: "Non-terminating repeating decimal",
        explanation: "0.999999... is a non-terminating repeating decimal where the digit 9 repeats infinitely. Any decimal where a digit or sequence of digits repeats infinitely is a non-terminating repeating decimal. Interestingly, 0.999... = 1, which can be proven using the algebraic method for converting repeating decimals to fractions. üîç",
        wrongAnswerExplanations: {
            "Terminating decimal": "A terminating decimal ends after a finite number of digits. 0.999... continues infinitely.",
            "Non-terminating non-repeating decimal": "The decimal 0.999... has a clear repeating pattern (the digit 9), so it's not non-repeating.",
            "None of these": "0.999... clearly fits the category of non-terminating repeating decimal."
