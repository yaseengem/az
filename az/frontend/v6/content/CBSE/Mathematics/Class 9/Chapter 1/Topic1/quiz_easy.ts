        correctAnswer: "They are closed under division",
        explanation: "Integers are not closed under division because dividing one integer by another may result in a non-integer. For example, 5 √∑ 2 = 2.5, which is not an integer. This makes division an operation that can take us outside the set of integers. ‚ûó",

Fractions like 3/4 belong to rational numbers, which are numbers that can be expressed as p/q where p and q are integers and q ‚â† 0. Since 3/4 can't be simplified to a whole number, it's not a natural number, whole number, or integer. üß©",

        correctAnswer: "The sum of two natural numbers is always greater than either of the original numbers",
        explanation: "If a and b are natural numbers, then a + b > a and a + b > b. This is because natural numbers are positive, so adding them increases the value. For example, 3 + 5 = 8, and 8 is greater than both 3 and 5. üìà",

        question: "Which of these is NOT a proper subset of the real numbers?",

        ],
        correctAnswer: "Real Numbers",
        explanation: "Real numbers are not a proper subset of themselves. A proper subset must be strictly contained within the set, meaning there must be at least one element in the larger set that is not in the subset. Natural numbers, integers, and rational numbers are all proper subsets of the real numbers. üìè",
