        correctAnswer: "Commutative property of addition",
        explanation: "The statement a + b = b + a demonstrates the commutative property of addition, which states that changing the order of addition doesn't change the result.

        correctAnswer: "a √ó (b + c) = a √ó b + a √ó c",
        explanation: "The distributive property of multiplication over addition states that a √ó (b + c) = a √ó b + a √ó c. This property allows us to 'distribute' the multiplication across terms in parentheses. For example, 2 √ó (3 + 4) = 2 √ó 3 + 2 √ó 4 = 6 + 8 = 14.

        correctAnswer: "-7.85",
        explanation: "3.14 √ó (-2.5) = -7.85. When multiplying a positive number by a negative number, the result is negative. We multiply the absolute values (3.14 √ó 2.5 = 7.85) and assign the negative sign. This is the standard rule for multiplication of real numbers with different signs: the product is negative. ‚ûó",

        explanation: "(-4) √∑ (-2) = 2. When dividing two negative numbers, the result is positive. This follows from the rule that the quotient of two numbers with the same sign is positive.

        correctAnswer: "Distributive property of multiplication over addition",
        explanation: "The equation 3 √ó (x + y) = 3x + 3y illustrates the distributive property of multiplication over addition. This property allows us to 'distribute' the multiplication across the terms inside the parentheses. It states that a(b + c) = ab + ac for all real numbers a, b, and c. üìä",

            "Commutative property of addition": "The commutative property of addition is a + b = b + a, which is not illustrated here.",

        correctAnswer: "‚àö2",
        explanation: "‚àö18 - ‚àö8 = ‚àö(9√ó2) - ‚àö(4√ó2) = 3‚àö2 - 2‚àö2 = ‚àö2. To subtract these terms, we first simplify each radical by identifying perfect square factors: ‚àö18 = ‚àö(9√ó2) = ‚àö9 √ó ‚àö2 = 3‚àö2 and ‚àö8 = ‚àö(4√ó2) = ‚àö4 √ó ‚àö2 = 2‚àö2.
