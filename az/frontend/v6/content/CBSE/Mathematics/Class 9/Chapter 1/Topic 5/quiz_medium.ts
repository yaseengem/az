Let's try a different approach:\nFrom a^(-2) = b^3, we get a^(-2) × b^(-3) = 1.\nFrom a^3 = b^(-2), we get a^3 × b^2 = 1.\nNow, let's raise the first equation to the power of 5/2 and the second equation to the power of 5/3:\n(a^(-2) × b^(-3))^(5/2) = 1^(5/2)\n(a^3 × b^2)^(5/3) = 1^(5/3)\nThis gives:\na^(-5) × b^(-15/2) = 1\na^5 × b^(10/3) = 1\nMultiplying these equations:\n(a^(-5) × b^(-15/2)) × (a^5 × b^(10/3)) = 1 × 1\na^(-5+5) × b^(-15/2+10/3) = 1\nb^(-15/2+10/3) = 1\nb^(-45/6+20/6) = 1\nb^(-25/6) = 1\nBut this implies b = 1, which doesn't seem right.

        explanation: "2^x × 3^(x+1) = 6^(2x-1)\nNote that 6 = 2×3, so 6^(2x-1) = (2×3)^(2x-1) = 2^(2x-1) × 3^(2x-1).\nSo, 2^x × 3^(x+1) = 2^(2x-1) × 3^(2x-1).\nEquating powers of 2: x = 2x-1, which gives x = 1.\nEquating powers of 3: x+1 = 2x-1, which gives x = 2.\nWait, there's a contradiction: x = 1 vs. x = 2. Let me double-check my work.\nWhen 6 = 2×3, we have 6^(2x-1) = (2×3)^(2x-1) = 2^(2x-1) × 3^(2x-1).\nSo the equation becomes 2^x × 3^(x+1) = 2^(2x-1) × 3^(2x-1).\nFor this to be true, the powers of each base must be equal:\n2^x = 2^(2x-1), which gives x = 2x-1, or x = 1.\n3^(x+1) = 3^(2x-1), which gives x+1 = 2x-1, or x = 2.\nSince we get different values for x (x = 1 and x = 2), it seems there's an error in the problem or my calculation.
