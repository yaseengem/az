# Summary of Linear Equations in Two Variables üî¢

In this final topic, we'll summarize all the important concepts we've learned about linear equations in two variables. This will help consolidate your understanding and prepare you for solving more complex problems. Let's review the key points! üìö

## Review of Linear Equations in Two Variables üìù

A linear equation in two variables is an equation that can be written in the form:
**ax + by + c = 0**

Where:
- a, b, and c are real numbers
- a and b cannot both be zero (otherwise it wouldn't involve two variables)
- x and y are variables that can take different values

### Standard Forms üìã

We've seen that linear equations can be written in several forms:
1. **Standard form**: ax + by + c = 0
2. **Slope-intercept form**: y = mx + c (where m is the slope and c is the y-intercept)
3. **Intercept form**: x/a + y/b = 1 (where a and b are the x and y-intercepts)

For example, the equation 2x + 3y - 6 = 0 can be rewritten as:
- y = (-2/3)x + 2 (slope-intercept form)
- x/3 + y/2 = 1 (intercept form)

## Solutions to Linear Equations in Two Variables ‚úÖ

A solution to a linear equation in two variables is an ordered pair (x, y) that satisfies the equation. For example, (1, 2) is a solution to 2x + 3y = 8 because 2(1) + 3(2) = 2 + 6 = 8.

### Key Properties of Solutions üîë

1. **Infinite solutions**: A linear equation in two variables has infinitely many solutions.
2. **Graphical representation**: Each solution corresponds to a point on the straight line represented by the equation.
3. **Finding solutions**: Given a value of x, we can find the corresponding value of y, and vice versa.

## Graphical Representation of Linear Equations üìä

The graph of a linear equation in two variables is always a straight line. To draw this line, we need only two distinct points, though it's good practice to plot a third point as a check.

### Steps to Graph a Linear Equation üìà

1. Find at least two solutions (ordered pairs) that satisfy the equation.
2. Plot these points on the coordinate plane.
3. Draw a straight line passing through these points.
4. Verify with a third point if possible.

For example, to graph 2x + y = 5:
- When x = 0, y = 5 (0, 5)
- When x = 2, y = 1 (2, 1)
- When x = -1, y = 7 (-1, 7)
- Plot these points and draw the line.

### Interpreting the Graph üîç

From the graph of a linear equation, we can determine:
- **y-intercept**: The point where the line crosses the y-axis (when x = 0).
- **x-intercept**: The point where the line crosses the x-axis (when y = 0).
- **Slope**: The steepness of the line, calculated as rise/run or (y‚ÇÇ - y‚ÇÅ)/(x‚ÇÇ - x‚ÇÅ).

### Special Cases of Linear Equations üåü

1. **Horizontal lines**: y = k (slope = 0)
   - Example: y = 3 represents a horizontal line passing through (0, 3)
   
2. **Vertical lines**: x = k (slope is undefined)
   - Example: x = -2 represents a vertical line passing through (-2, 0)

## Applications of Linear Equations in Two Variables üåç

Linear equations in two variables have numerous real-world applications:

### 1. Economics and Finance üí∞
- **Cost and revenue analysis**: If C = mx + b represents the cost of producing x items (where m is the cost per item and b is the fixed cost), then the graph shows how cost changes with production.
- **Supply and demand**: Supply and demand curves are often approximated by linear equations, and their intersection represents the market equilibrium.

### 2. Physics and Engineering ‚öôÔ∏è
- **Motion problems**: In a distance-time graph, a straight line represents motion at constant speed, with the slope representing velocity.
- **Conversion between units**: The equation y = mx represents the linear relationship between different units.

### 3. Geometry üìê
- **Calculating areas and perimeters**: Unknown dimensions can be found by setting up linear equations.
- **Coordinates of points on lines**: If points lie on a straight line, their coordinates satisfy the same linear equation.

## Solving Systems of Linear Equations üß©

When dealing with two or more linear equations involving the same variables, we have a system of linear equations. Such systems can be solved by:

1. **Graphical method**: Finding the point of intersection of the lines.
2. **Substitution method**: Expressing one variable in terms of the other and substituting.
3. **Elimination method**: Adding or subtracting equations to eliminate one variable.

### Possible Outcomes ‚≠ê

A system of two linear equations in two variables can have:
- **Exactly one solution**: The lines intersect at a single point.
- **No solution**: The lines are parallel and never meet.
- **Infinitely many solutions**: The lines are coincident (the same line).

## Common Mistakes to Avoid ‚ö†Ô∏è

As you work with linear equations, be careful to avoid these common errors:

1. **Sign errors**: Be cautious with negative signs when rearranging terms.
   Example: Rewriting 2x + 3y = 6 as y = -2/3x + 2, not y = 2/3x + 2.

2. **Inconsistent substitution**: When finding ordered pairs, ensure that both coordinates are substituted correctly into the equation.
   Example: For 3x + 2y = 12, if x = 2, then 3(2) + 2y = 12, so 6 + 2y = 12, which gives y = 3.

3. **Plotting errors**: Double-check the coordinates when plotting points.
   Example: The point (2, -3) is 2 units right and 3 units down from the origin.

## Practice with Linear Equations üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Let's review some examples:

### Example 1: Finding Solutions
For the equation 3x + 2y = 12:
- If x = 0: 3(0) + 2y = 12 ‚Üí y = 6
- If y = 0: 3x + 2(0) = 12 ‚Üí x = 4
- If x = 2: 3(2) + 2y = 12 ‚Üí 6 + 2y = 12 ‚Üí y = 3
Solutions include (0, 6), (4, 0), and (2, 3)

### Example 2: Graphical Analysis
Graph the equation y = 2x - 3 and identify its:
- y-intercept: When x = 0, y = -3, so the y-intercept is (0, -3)
- x-intercept: When y = 0, 0 = 2x - 3, so x = 1.5, giving an x-intercept of (1.5, 0)
- Slope: m = 2, indicating the line rises 2 units for every 1 unit moved to the right

### Example 3: Real-World Application
A taxi charges ‚Çπ50 as a base fare plus ‚Çπ10 per kilometer traveled. This can be represented by the equation C = 10d + 50, where C is the cost in rupees and d is the distance in kilometers.
- If you travel 5 km, the cost will be C = 10(5) + 50 = ‚Çπ100
- If your bill is ‚Çπ200, you can find the distance: 200 = 10d + 50 ‚Üí 10d = 150 ‚Üí d = 15 km

## Quick Review Questions ‚ùì

1. **Question**: If (3, k) is a solution to 2x + 3y = 15, what is the value of k?
   **Answer**: Substitute x = 3: 2(3) + 3k = 15 ‚Üí 6 + 3k = 15 ‚Üí 3k = 9 ‚Üí k = 3

2. **Question**: What is the slope of the line 4x - 3y + 12 = 0?
   **Answer**: Rearrange to y = mx + c form: -3y = -4x - 12 ‚Üí y = (4/3)x + 4
   So the slope is 4/3

3. **Question**: Two points on a line are (1, -2) and (4, 7). What is the equation of this line?
   **Answer**: 
   Slope = (7 - (-2))/(4 - 1) = 9/3 = 3
   Using y - y‚ÇÅ = m(x - x‚ÇÅ): y - (-2) = 3(x - 1)
   y + 2 = 3x - 3
   y = 3x - 5
