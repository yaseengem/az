# Introduction to Linear Equations in Two Variables üåü

Linear equations are the foundation of algebra and one of the most widely used mathematical tools in real-world applications! üöÄ In this topic, we'll explore linear equations that involve two variables and understand their fundamental concepts.

## What is a Linear Equation in Two Variables? üìù

A linear equation in two variables is an equation that can be written in the form:

**ax + by + c = 0**

Where:
- x and y are variables
- a, b are coefficients (non-zero real numbers)
- c is a constant term
- The highest power of any variable is 1 (no variables are squared, cubed, etc.)

Some examples of linear equations in two variables include:
- 2x + 3y = 6
- x - y = 4
- 5x + 2y - 10 = 0
- y = 2x + 3

## Standard Forms of Linear Equations üìä

Linear equations can be written in different forms:

1. **Standard Form**: ax + by + c = 0
   Example: 3x + 4y - 12 = 0

2. **Slope-Intercept Form**: y = mx + b
   Where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept
   Example: y = 2x + 3 (equivalent to 2x - y + 3 = 0)

3. **Intercept Form**: (x/a) + (y/b) = 1
   Where a is the x-intercept and b is the y-intercept
   Example: (x/4) + (y/6) = 1

Converting between these forms is an important skill. For instance, to convert 3x + 4y - 12 = 0 to slope-intercept form:
- Solve for y: 4y = -3x + 12
- Divide by 4: y = (-3/4)x + 3

## How Linear Equations Differ from Linear Equations in One Variable üîç

Let's compare:

**Linear Equation in One Variable**:
- Form: ax + b = 0
- Has exactly one solution (a single value for x)
- Represented by a point on the number line
- Example: 2x + 5 = 0 has the solution x = -2.5

**Linear Equation in Two Variables**:
- Form: ax + by + c = 0
- Has infinitely many solutions (pairs of values for x and y)
- Represented by a line in the coordinate plane
- Example: 2x + 3y = 6 has solutions like (3, 0), (0, 2), (1.5, 1), etc.

## Solutions of Linear Equations in Two Variables üß©

A solution of a linear equation in two variables is an ordered pair (x, y) that satisfies the equation.

For example, for the equation 2x + 3y = 6:
- (3, 0) is a solution because 2(3) + 3(0) = 6 ‚úì
- (0, 2) is a solution because 2(0) + 3(2) = 6 ‚úì
- (1.5, 1) is a solution because 2(1.5) + 3(1) = 6 ‚úì
- (1, 1) is NOT a solution because 2(1) + 3(1) = 5 ‚â† 6 ‚ùå

In fact, a linear equation in two variables has infinitely many solutions! These solutions form a straight line when plotted on the coordinate plane.

## Finding Solutions to Linear Equations üî¢

There are several ways to find solutions:

1. **Choose a value for one variable and solve for the other**
   For 2x + 3y = 6:
   - If x = 0, then 3y = 6, so y = 2
   - If y = 0, then 2x = 6, so x = 3

2. **Create a table of values**
   For 2x + 3y = 6:
   | x | y |
   |---|---|
   | 0 | 2 |
   | 3 | 0 |
   | 1.5 | 1 |
   | -3 | 4 |

3. **Using the slope-intercept form (y = mx + b)**
   For 2x + 3y = 6, rewrite as y = (-2/3)x + 2
   - When x = 0, y = 2 (y-intercept)
   - When x = 3, y = (-2/3)(3) + 2 = 0
   - When x = -3, y = (-2/3)(-3) + 2 = 4

## Application Examples üåê

1. **Cost Equations**:
   If a concert charges $10 for adults and $5 for children, and the total revenue is $500, we can write:
   10a + 5c = 500
   Where a is the number of adults and c is the number of children.
   
   Possible solutions include (50, 0), (0, 100), (25, 50), etc.

2. **Distance and Speed**:
   If a car travels at 60 km/h and a motorcycle at 80 km/h in the same direction, and the motorcycle is 40 km ahead, when will the car catch up?
   
   If t represents the time (in hours), we get:
   60t = 80t - 40
   -20t = -40
   t = 2
   
   So, the car will catch up in 2 hours.

## Properties of Linear Equations in Two Variables üìê

1. **Graphical Representation**: A linear equation in two variables always represents a straight line in the coordinate plane.

2. **Infinite Solutions**: A linear equation in two variables has infinitely many solutions, forming a continuous line.

3. **Intercepts**: A linear equation typically has an x-intercept (where y = 0) and a y-intercept (where x = 0), except for vertical or horizontal lines.

4. **Parallel Lines**: Two lines with the same slope but different y-intercepts are parallel and have no common solution.

5. **Intersecting Lines**: Two lines with different slopes intersect at exactly one point, which is the common solution to both equations.

## Understanding the Significance of Coefficients üßÆ

In the standard form ax + by + c = 0:

1. **If a = 0**: The equation becomes by + c = 0, which is a horizontal line.
   Example: 0x + 3y + 6 = 0 simplifies to y = -2

2. **If b = 0**: The equation becomes ax + c = 0, which is a vertical line.
   Example: 4x + 0y - 8 = 0 simplifies to x = 2

3. **If c = 0**: The equation becomes ax + by = 0, which is a line passing through the origin (0, 0).
   Example: 2x + 3y = 0

4. **If both a and b are non-zero**: The line has a non-vertical and non-horizontal slope.
   Example: 2x + 3y - 6 = 0

## Real-Life Connections üèôÔ∏è

Linear equations are used in many real-life scenarios:

1. **Economics**: Price-demand relationships, cost-revenue analysis
2. **Physics**: Motion equations, force relationships
3. **Engineering**: Structural analysis, electrical circuits
4. **Finance**: Interest calculations, budget planning
5. **Computer Graphics**: Line drawing algorithms

## Sample Questions with Solutions üìù

**Question 1**: Determine if (2, 1) is a solution to the equation 3x - 2y = 4.
**Solution**: Substitute x = 2 and y = 1 into 3x - 2y = 4
3(2) - 2(1) = 6 - 2 = 4 ‚úì
Yes, (2, 1) is a solution.

**Question 2**: Find three solutions to the equation 2x + y = 7.
**Solution**:
- If x = 0, then y = 7. So (0, 7) is a solution.
- If x = 2, then y = 7 - 2(2) = 3. So (2, 3) is a solution.
- If x = 3.5, then y = 7 - 2(3.5) = 0. So (3.5, 0) is a solution.

**Question 3**: A movie theater charges $8 for adults and $5 for children. If 120 tickets were sold for a total of $810, how many adults and how many children attended?
**Solution**:
Let a = number of adults and c = number of children
We have the equations:
- a + c = 120 (total people)
- 8a + 5c = 810 (total revenue)

From the first equation: a = 120 - c
Substitute into the second equation:
8(120 - c) + 5c = 810
960 - 8c + 5c = 810
960 - 3c = 810
-3c = -150
c = 50

Therefore, a = 120 - 50 = 70

So, 70 adults and 50 children attended the movie.
