# Chapter 7: Triangles - Summary 📐

In this chapter, we've explored triangles, one of the most fundamental shapes in geometry. Let's consolidate what we've learned with a comprehensive summary that connects all the key concepts we've covered. This overview will help reinforce your understanding and prepare you for applying these concepts in future mathematics topics. 🌟

## Basic Concepts of Triangles 🔍

A triangle is a closed figure formed by three line segments. Here are some fundamental properties:

1. **Sum of Internal Angles**: The sum of all internal angles in any triangle is 180°.
   - If angles are α, β, and γ, then α + β + γ = 180°

2. **Types of Triangles Based on Sides**:
   - **Scalene Triangle**: All sides have different lengths
   - **Isosceles Triangle**: Two sides have equal lengths
   - **Equilateral Triangle**: All three sides have equal lengths

3. **Types of Triangles Based on Angles**:
   - **Acute Triangle**: All angles are less than 90°
   - **Right Triangle**: One angle is exactly 90°
   - **Obtuse Triangle**: One angle is greater than 90°

## Congruence of Triangles ≅

Two triangles are congruent if they have exactly the same shape and size. In congruent triangles, all corresponding sides and angles are equal.

### Criteria for Congruence:

1. **SSS (Side-Side-Side)**: If three sides of one triangle equal the corresponding sides of another triangle.
   
   Example: If AB = PQ, BC = QR, and AC = PR, then triangle ABC ≅ triangle PQR.

2. **SAS (Side-Angle-Side)**: If two sides and the included angle of one triangle equal the corresponding sides and included angle of another.
   
   Example: If AB = PQ, ∠ABC = ∠PQR, and BC = QR, then triangle ABC ≅ triangle PQR.

3. **ASA (Angle-Side-Angle)**: If two angles and the included side of one triangle equal the corresponding angles and included side of another.
   
   Example: If ∠ABC = ∠PQR, BC = QR, and ∠BCA = ∠QRP, then triangle ABC ≅ triangle PQR.

4. **AAS (Angle-Angle-Side)**: If two angles and a non-included side of one triangle equal the corresponding angles and side of another.
   
   Example: If ∠ABC = ∠PQR, ∠BCA = ∠QRP, and AB = PQ, then triangle ABC ≅ triangle PQR.

5. **RHS (Right angle-Hypotenuse-Side)**: If the hypotenuse and one side of a right-angled triangle equal the hypotenuse and the corresponding side of another right-angled triangle.
   
   Example: If ∠ABC = ∠PQR = 90°, AC = PR (hypotenuse), and BC = QR, then triangle ABC ≅ triangle PQR.

## Properties of Isosceles and Equilateral Triangles 🔹

### Isosceles Triangle Properties:
- If two sides of a triangle are equal, then angles opposite to these sides are equal.
- Conversely, if two angles of a triangle are equal, then sides opposite to these angles are equal.

Example: In an isosceles triangle with AB = AC, the angles opposite to these sides, ∠ABC and ∠ACB, are equal.

### Equilateral Triangle Properties:
- All sides are equal: AB = BC = CA
- All angles are equal: ∠ABC = ∠BCA = ∠CAB = 60°
- The perpendicular from any vertex to the opposite side divides that side into two equal parts
- All medians, altitudes, and angle bisectors coincide and are equal in length

## The Midpoint Theorem and Its Applications 📍

### Midpoint Theorem:
The line segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to and half the length of the third side.

Example: If D is the midpoint of AB and E is the midpoint of AC in triangle ABC, then DE is parallel to BC and DE = (1/2)BC.

### Converse of Midpoint Theorem:
If a line divides two sides of a triangle proportionally, then it is parallel to the third side.

Example: If D is on AB and E is on AC such that AD/DB = AE/EC, then DE is parallel to BC.

## Inequalities in Triangles 📏

1. **Side-Angle Relationship**:
   - If two sides of a triangle are unequal, the angle opposite to the longer side is larger.
   - Conversely, if two angles of a triangle are unequal, the side opposite to the larger angle is longer.

   Example: In triangle ABC, if AB > AC, then ∠ACB > ∠ABC.

2. **Triangle Inequality**:
   - The sum of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the third side.
   - |a - b| < c < a + b, where a, b, and c are the sides of the triangle.

   Example: In a triangle with sides 3 cm, 4 cm, and 5 cm:
   - 3 + 4 = 7 > 5 ✓
   - 3 + 5 = 8 > 4 ✓
   - 4 + 5 = 9 > 3 ✓
   Therefore, these three lengths can form a triangle.

## Special Lines and Points in Triangles 🌟

1. **Median**: A line segment joining a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.
   - The three medians of a triangle meet at a point called the centroid.
   - The centroid divides each median in the ratio 2:1 from the vertex.

2. **Altitude**: A perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the opposite side.
   - The three altitudes of a triangle meet at a point called the orthocenter.

3. **Angle Bisector**: A line segment that bisects an angle of the triangle.
   - The three angle bisectors of a triangle meet at a point called the incenter.
   - The incenter is equidistant from the three sides and is the center of the inscribed circle.

4. **Perpendicular Bisector**: A line that passes through the midpoint of a side and is perpendicular to it.
   - The three perpendicular bisectors of a triangle meet at a point called the circumcenter.
   - The circumcenter is equidistant from the three vertices and is the center of the circumscribed circle.

## Applications of Triangle Congruence 🏗️

The concept of triangle congruence has numerous practical applications:

1. **Structural Design**: Triangles are used in the construction of bridges, roofs, and towers because they distribute weight evenly and are structurally stable.

2. **Surveying**: Triangulation techniques are used to measure distances and map terrain by forming triangles with known measurements.

3. **Navigation**: Triangulation is used to determine the position of ships, aircraft, and in GPS systems.

4. **Computer Graphics**: Polygon meshes (made up of triangles) are used to create 3D models in computer graphics.

## Problem-Solving Examples 🧩

1. **Example 1**: In triangle ABC, angle B = 50° and angle C = 60°. What is angle A?
   
   Solution: We know that the sum of all angles in a triangle is 180°.
   So, angle A = 180° - (angle B + angle C) = 180° - (50° + 60°) = 180° - 110° = 70°.

2. **Example 2**: In an isosceles triangle ABC, if AB = AC and angle B = 50°, find angles A and C.
   
   Solution: Since AB = AC, the triangle is isosceles with equal angles B and C.
   So, angle B = angle C = 50°.
   Now, angle A = 180° - (angle B + angle C) = 180° - (50° + 50°) = 180° - 100° = 80°.

3. **Example 3**: In triangle ABC, if AB = 7 cm, BC = 5 cm, and AC = 8 cm, which is the largest angle?
   
   Solution: The largest angle is opposite to the longest side. Since AC = 8 cm is the longest side, angle B (opposite to AC) is the largest angle.

4. **Example 4**: Given triangle ABC where D is the midpoint of BC and E is the midpoint of AC. If AB = 10 cm, find the length of DE.
   
   Solution: By the midpoint theorem, DE is parallel to and half the length of AB.
   Therefore, DE = (1/2) × AB = (1/2) × 10 cm = 5 cm.
