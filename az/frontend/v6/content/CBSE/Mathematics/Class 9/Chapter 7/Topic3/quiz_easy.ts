        correctAnswer: "AAS",
        explanation: "Since two angles (‚à†A = ‚à†D, ‚à†C = ‚à†F) and a non-included side (AB = DE) are equal, the AAS (Angle-Angle-Side) criterion applies. This criterion states that if two angles and a non-included side of one triangle are equal to the corresponding parts of another triangle, the triangles are congruent. üìê",

        question: "What happens if you have two triangles with two pairs of equal sides, but the included angles are not equal?",
        options: [
            "The triangles are still congruent",
            "The triangles must be equilateral",
            "The triangles are not necessarily congruent",
            "The triangles must be right-angled"
        ],
        correctAnswer: "The triangles are not necessarily congruent",
        explanation: "If two triangles have two pairs of equal sides but the included angles are not equal, the triangles are not necessarily congruent. This doesn't satisfy the SAS criterion, which requires the included angles to be equal. Different included angles can result in triangles with different shapes and sizes, even if two pairs of sides are equal. üìè",
        wrongAnswerExplanations: {
            "The triangles are still congruent": "Without equal included angles, the SAS criterion isn't satisfied, so congruence isn't guaranteed.",
            "The triangles must be equilateral": "There's no reason the triangles must be equilateral based on this information.",
            "The triangles must be right-angled": "There's no reason the triangles must be right-angled based on this information."
