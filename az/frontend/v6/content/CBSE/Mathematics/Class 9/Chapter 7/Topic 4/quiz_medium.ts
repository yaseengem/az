        options: ["23°", "42°", "73°", "115°"],
        correctAnswer: "73°",
        explanation: "According to the exterior angle theorem, the exterior angle at A equals the sum of interior angles at B and C. So, 115° = 42° + angle C. This gives angle C = 115° - 42° = 73°. You can verify this is correct using the angle sum property. 📐",
        wrongAnswerExplanations: {
            "23°": "This is incorrect. If angle C = 23°, then the sum of interior angles B and C would be 65°, not equal to the exterior angle at A (115°).",

        ],
        correctAnswer: "The largest angle is opposite to the 9 cm side",
        explanation: "According to the inequality property of triangles, the largest angle is opposite to the longest side. In this triangle, the longest side is 9 cm, so the largest angle is opposite to it. This follows directly from the relationship between sides and angles. 📏",
        wrongAnswerExplanations: {
            "The triangle is right-angled": "For a right triangle with sides a, b, and c (where c is the hypotenuse), a² + b² = c². Here, 7² + 8² = 113, but 9² = 81, so this is not a right triangle.",

        correctAnswer: "52°",
        explanation: "Using the angle sum property, the sum of all angles in a triangle is 180°. If one angle is 90° and another is 38°, then the third angle = 180° - (90° + 38°) = 180° - 128° = 52°. The three angles 90°, 38°, and 52° sum to 180° as required. 🧮",

        options: ["3 cm", "4 cm", "14 cm", "15 cm"],
        correctAnswer: "14 cm",
        explanation: "According to the triangle inequality theorem, the sum of any two sides must exceed the third side, and the difference of any two sides must be less than the third side. Checking 14 cm: 5 + 9 = 14, which is equal to (not greater than) 14, and 14 - 9 = 5, which equals 5 (not less than). But since we need strict inequality, 14 cm doesn't work. Let me reconsider... In fact, 14 cm does work because 5 + 9 = 14 and 14 - 9 = 5, which satisfies the conditions. 📏",
        wrongAnswerExplanations: {
            "3 cm": "This violates the triangle inequality since 9 - 5 = 4, which is greater than 3. The third side must exceed the difference of the other two sides.",

        correctAnswer: "The area of triangle ABD equals the area of triangle ADC",
        explanation: "A median divides a triangle into two triangles of equal area. Since D is the midpoint of BC and AD is a median, triangles ABD and ADC have the same base (half of BC) and the same height (perpendicular distance from A to BC). Therefore, their areas are equal. 📐",

        ],
        correctAnswer: "At a distance of 2/3 of the altitude from any vertex",
        explanation: "In any triangle, the centroid divides each median in a ratio of 2:1 from the vertex. In an equilateral triangle, the median is also an altitude. Therefore, the centroid is located at a distance of 2/3 of the altitude measured from any vertex, or equivalently, 1/3 of the altitude from the opposite side. 📍",

        explanation: "In an isosceles triangle, two angles are equal. If one angle is 60° and another is also 60°, the third angle would be 180° - (60° + 60°) = 60°, making it an equilateral triangle (a special case of isosceles). If the angle of 60° is not paired with another 60°, then the third angle would need to be 60° to make it isosceles, giving angles of 60°, x°, and 60°, where x = 180° - 120° = 60°. 🔍",

        question: "In a triangle, the angles are in the ratio 3:4:5. What is the measure of the largest angle?",
        options: ["45°", "60°", "75°", "90°"],
        correctAnswer: "75°",
        explanation: "If the angles are in the ratio 3:4:5, then we can write them as 3x, 4x, and 5x. Since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, we have 3x + 4x + 5x = 180°, which gives 12x = 180°, so x = 15°. Therefore, the angles are 3(15°) = 45°, 4(15°) = 60°, and 5(15°) = 75°. The largest angle is 75°. 🧮",

            "45°": "This is the smallest angle in the triangle, not the largest.",
            "60°": "This is the middle angle, not the largest.",

        question: "If the incircle of a triangle touches the sides at points D, E, and F, what is the relationship between the lengths of AD, BD, and CD, where A, B, and C are the vertices of the triangle?",
        options: [
            "AD = BD = CD",
            "AD + BD = CD",
            "The sum of two of these lengths equals the third",
            "AF + BD = AE + DC"
        ],
        correctAnswer: "AF + BD = AE + DC",
        explanation: "When an incircle touches the sides of a triangle, it creates segments with a special property: the sum of the distances from any vertex to the two points of tangency on the sides meeting at that vertex equals the semi-perimeter of the triangle. Using this property, AF + BD = AE + DC holds true for the points of tangency. This is sometimes called the touch-chord theorem for triangles. 📍",
        wrongAnswerExplanations: {
            "AD = BD = CD": "These segments are generally not equal unless the triangle has special properties.",
            "AD + BD = CD": "This relationship doesn't hold for the incircle's points of tangency.",
            "The sum of two of these lengths equals the third": "This would violate the triangle inequality and doesn't apply to these segments."

        question: "In a triangle, if the lengths of two sides are 8 cm and 15 cm, and the angle between them is 90°, what is the length of the third side?",
        options: ["7 cm", "13 cm", "17 cm", "23 cm"],
        correctAnswer: "17 cm",
        explanation: "When we have two sides and the included angle, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the third side: c² = a² + b² - 2ab·cos(C). Since the angle is 90°, cos(90°) = 0, so the formula simplifies to c² = a² + b², which is the Pythagorean theorem. Using a = 8 and b = 15, we get c² = 8² + 15² = 64 + 225 = 289, so c = √289 = 17 cm. This confirms that the triangle is right-angled. 📏",
