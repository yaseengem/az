        explanation: "The steepness (slope) of a line in a line graph indicates the rate of change between data points. A steep upward slope shows a rapid increase, a steep downward slope shows a rapid decrease, and a gentle slope indicates a slow change. A horizontal line shows no change. üìà",

        explanation: "A peak in a frequency polygon indicates a concentration of data values, often corresponding to the mode or a modal class. It shows where the frequency is highest, meaning more data points fall in that particular range than in neighboring ranges. üìâ",

        explanation: "A box plot (or box-and-whisker plot) primarily shows the five-number summary of a dataset: minimum, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and maximum. It also clearly identifies outliers as individual points beyond the whiskers, making it excellent for comparing distributions. üì¶",
