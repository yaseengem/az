        correctAnswer: "Class intervals of width 5, starting from 15",
        explanation: "When creating a histogram, you want a reasonable number of intervals (usually 5-15) that clearly show the distribution pattern. For this data ranging from 15 to 40, using class intervals of width 5 starting from 15 (15-20, 20-25, etc.) would create 6 classes, which is appropriate.

        explanation: "The modal class is the class with the highest frequency. In this distribution, the class 160-165 cm has the highest frequency of 18 students. The class mark is calculated as the average of the lower and upper limits: (160 + 165)/2 = 325/2 = 162.5 cm. Therefore, the class mark of the modal class is 162.5 cm. üìè",

        correctAnswer: "Adjust the height of each bar by dividing the frequency by the class width",
        explanation: "When class intervals in a histogram have unequal widths, the height of each bar should be adjusted by dividing the frequency by the class width to maintain the property that area represents frequency. This gives the frequency density (frequency per unit width), ensuring that the area of each bar is proportional to the class frequency.

            "40 classes"
        ],
        correctAnswer: "8 classes",
        explanation: "For creating a grouped frequency distribution, a common guideline is to use between 5-15 classes. With 40 data points ranging from 24 to 60 (a range of 36), using 8 classes would give a class width of about 5 years (36√∑8 = 4.5, rounded to 5). This provides enough detail to see the distribution pattern without being too cluttered or too condensed. üìä",

        explanation: "Box and whisker plots (boxplots) are ideal for comparing the consistency of two datasets as they display the median, quartiles, range, and potential outliers. They would clearly show that Batsman B has a more compact distribution (more consistent performance) while Batsman A has a wider spread with both very high and very low scores.

The ogive plots cumulative frequencies against the upper boundaries of each class.
