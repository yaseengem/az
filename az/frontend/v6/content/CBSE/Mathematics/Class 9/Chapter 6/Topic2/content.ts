# Basic Terms and Definitions in Geometry 📐

Welcome to the foundation of geometric language! 🌟 In this topic, we'll explore the essential terms and definitions that will help us communicate precisely about lines and angles. Having a solid understanding of these basic terms is crucial before we dive deeper into more complex geometric concepts. Let's build our geometric vocabulary together! 📚

## Point ⚫

A **point** is the most fundamental element in geometry. It represents a specific location in space but has no size—no length, width, or thickness.

- Points are typically labeled with uppercase letters: A, B, C, etc.
- A point is represented by a dot in geometric diagrams.
- Examples: The tip of a pencil touching paper, the intersection of two lines, a specific location on a map.

*Key Insight:* While a point has no dimension (it's zero-dimensional), it helps us define all other geometric figures.

## Line ↔️

A **line** is a straight one-dimensional figure that extends infinitely in both directions.

- A line has length but no width or thickness.
- A line can be named using:
  * Two points on the line, like line AB (written as $\\overleftrightarrow{AB}$)
  * A single lowercase letter, like line l
- Examples: The edge of a perfectly straight ruler extended infinitely, the horizon line where the sky appears to meet the earth (if the earth were flat).

*Key Insight:* Two distinct points determine exactly one line.

## Line Segment 📏

A **line segment** is a part of a line consisting of two endpoints and all points between them.

- Unlike a line, a line segment has a definite length.
- A line segment is denoted by the two endpoints, like AB or $\\overline{AB}$.
- Examples: The edge of a ruler, a side of a polygon, the distance between two cities on a map.

*Key Insight:* The length of a line segment AB is often written as |AB|.

## Ray 📡

A **ray** is a part of a line that has exactly one endpoint and extends infinitely in one direction.

- A ray is denoted by an arrow over the two points, like $\\overrightarrow{AB}$, where A is the endpoint and the ray extends infinitely through B.
- Examples: A beam of light from a flashlight, a sunray, the path of a laser pointer.

*Key Insight:* A ray has a starting point but no ending point.

## Collinear Points 📍📍📍

**Collinear points** are points that lie on the same straight line.

- Any two distinct points are always collinear (they determine a unique line).
- Three or more distinct points may or may not be collinear.
- Example: Points on a straight road, the corners along one edge of a rectangular table.

*Key Insight:* To check if three points A, B, and C are collinear, measure distances |AB|, |BC|, and |AC|. If |AB| + |BC| = |AC|, then the points are collinear.

## Angle 📐

An **angle** is formed when two rays share a common endpoint.

- The common endpoint is called the vertex of the angle.
- The two rays are called the arms or sides of the angle.
- Angles can be named in three ways:
  * By its vertex (e.g., ∠A)
  * By three points, with the vertex in the middle (e.g., ∠BAC)
  * By a lowercase letter placed inside the angle (e.g., ∠a)

### Types of Angles Based on Measure

#### Acute Angle 🔹

- Measures less than 90° (a right angle)
- Examples: 30°, 45°, 75°
- Real-life example: The angle formed by the hour and minute hands of a clock at 2:00

#### Right Angle 📐

- Measures exactly 90°
- Denoted by a small square at the vertex
- Examples: The corner of a notebook, the intersection of perpendicular roads
- Real-life example: The angle between adjacent walls in most rooms

#### Obtuse Angle 🔻

- Measures more than 90° but less than 180°
- Examples: 120°, 150°
- Real-life example: The angle between the hands of a clock at 10:00

#### Straight Angle 📏

- Measures exactly 180°
- Forms a straight line
- Examples: The angle formed when you look straight ahead
- Real-life example: The angle at any point along a straight road

#### Reflex Angle 🔄

- Measures more than 180° but less than 360°
- Examples: 270°, 315°
- Real-life example: The angle traced by the hour hand of a clock from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM

#### Complete Angle (Full Rotation) 🔄

- Measures exactly 360°
- Represents a complete rotation
- Real-life example: The angle traced by the hour hand of a clock over 12 hours

## Perpendicular Lines ⊥

Two lines are **perpendicular** when they intersect to form right angles (90°).

- Perpendicular lines are denoted by the symbol ⊥, as in l₁ ⊥ l₂.
- Examples: The intersection of north-south and east-west roads on a grid, the corner of a sheet of paper.

*Key Insight:* When two lines are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1 (if neither line is vertical).

## Parallel Lines ∥

Two lines are **parallel** when they never intersect, no matter how far they are extended.

- Parallel lines are denoted by the symbol ∥, as in l₁ ∥ l₂.
- Parallel lines maintain the same distance between them at all points.
- Examples: Railway tracks, opposite edges of a ruler, lines of latitude on a globe.

*Key Insight:* Parallel lines have the same slope (if neither is vertical).

## Transversal ↗

A **transversal** is a line that intersects two or more lines at distinct points.

- When a transversal crosses two lines, it forms eight angles.
- Examples: A road crossing over multiple railway tracks, a diagonal line crossing parallel lines on graph paper.

*Key Insight:* Transversals help us understand relationships between parallel and non-parallel lines.

## Adjacent Angles 🔄

**Adjacent angles** are angles that:
1. Share a common vertex
2. Have a common side
3. Do not overlap (have no common interior points)

- Examples: Two adjacent slices of a pizza, angles formed by the hands of a clock.

*Key Insight:* The sum of adjacent angles is not fixed but depends on the specific angles.

## Linear Pair 📏

A **linear pair** consists of two adjacent angles whose non-common arms form a straight line.

- The sum of angles in a linear pair is always 180°.
- Examples: The angles formed when a transversal intersects a line, two adjacent angles along a straight road.

*Key Insight:* Angles in a linear pair are supplementary.

## Vertical Angles ⊗

**Vertical angles** (or vertically opposite angles) are pairs of non-adjacent angles formed when two lines intersect.

- Vertical angles are always equal in measure.
- Examples: The opposite angles formed at a crossroads, the angles of an hourglass.

*Key Insight:* If two lines intersect, then the vertical angles formed are equal.

## Complementary Angles 🔄

Two angles are **complementary** when their sum equals 90°.

- Examples: 30° and 60°, 45° and 45°, 10° and 80°.
- These angles need not be adjacent.

*Key Insight:* Each angle is said to be the complement of the other.

## Supplementary Angles 🔄

Two angles are **supplementary** when their sum equals 180°.

- Examples: 30° and 150°, 90° and 90°, 75° and 105°.
- These angles need not be adjacent.

*Key Insight:* Each angle is said to be the supplement of the other.

## Practical Applications 🌍

Understanding these basic terms and definitions has numerous practical applications:

1. **Architecture and Construction**: Architects and builders use perpendicular and parallel lines to ensure buildings are structurally sound and aesthetically pleasing.

2. **Navigation**: Pilots and sailors use angles to chart courses and determine positions.

3. **Art and Design**: Artists and designers use geometric principles to create balanced and harmonious compositions.

4. **Carpentry**: Carpenters use right angles to ensure furniture pieces fit together properly.

5. **Surveying**: Land surveyors use angles and distances to measure and map land boundaries.

## Example Problems 📝

### Example 1:
If two angles form a linear pair and one angle measures 65°, what is the measure of the other angle?

**Solution**:
Since angles in a linear pair are supplementary, their sum is 180°.
Let the unknown angle be x.
65° + x = 180°
x = 180° - 65° = 115°

### Example 2:
If angles A and B are complementary, and angle A is 25°, what is angle B?

**Solution**:
Since A and B are complementary, A + B = 90°.
Given A = 25°, we have:
25° + B = 90°
B = 90° - 25° = 65°
