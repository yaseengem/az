# Laws of Exponents for Real Numbers 💪

Exponents (or powers) allow us to write repeated multiplication in a compact form. Instead of writing 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2, we can write 2⁵. In this topic, we'll explore the laws of exponents for real numbers, which are powerful tools for simplifying expressions and solving problems efficiently. 🚀

## Understanding Exponents 🧩

An exponent indicates how many times a number (the base) is multiplied by itself:

a^n = a × a × a × ... × a (n times)

Where:
- a is the base
- n is the exponent or power

**Examples**:
- 2³ = 2 × 2 × 2 = 8
- 10² = 10 × 10 = 100
- 5¹ = 5
- (1/2)² = (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4

## Laws of Exponents 📜

These laws work for all real number bases (except where division by zero would occur) and integer exponents. Let's explore these powerful rules:

### 1. Product Law: a^m × a^n = a^(m+n) 🔄

When multiplying expressions with the same base, add the exponents.

**Examples**:
- 2³ × 2⁴ = 2³⁺⁴ = 2⁷ = 128
- x² × x⁵ = x²⁺⁵ = x⁷
- √2 × √2 = 2^(1/2) × 2^(1/2) = 2^(1/2+1/2) = 2¹ = 2

**Real-life application**: If you double your money every year, after 3 years you have 2³ = 8 times your initial amount. After another 4 years, you'd have 2⁴ times that amount, or 2³⁺⁴ = 2⁷ = 128 times your initial amount.

### 2. Quotient Law: a^m ÷ a^n = a^(m-n) 📉

When dividing expressions with the same base, subtract the exponents.

**Examples**:
- 5⁶ ÷ 5⁴ = 5⁶⁻⁴ = 5² = 25
- x⁸ ÷ x³ = x⁸⁻³ = x⁵
- 10⁵ ÷ 10⁵ = 10⁰ = 1

**Real-life application**: If a population has grown to 3⁵ times its original size, and then decreases by a factor of 3², the net growth would be 3⁵ ÷ 3² = 3⁵⁻² = 3³ = 27 times the original size.

### 3. Power of a Power Law: (a^m)^n = a^(m×n) 🔄

When raising a power to another power, multiply the exponents.

**Examples**:
- (2³)² = 2³×² = 2⁶ = 64
- (x²)⁵ = x²×⁵ = x¹⁰
- (√3)² = (3^(1/2))² = 3^(1/2×2) = 3¹ = 3

**Real-life application**: If you triple your investment every year, after 2 years you have 3² = 9 times your initial amount. If this pattern continued for 3 such 2-year periods, you'd have (3²)³ = 3²×³ = 3⁶ = 729 times your initial investment.

### 4. Power of a Product Law: (a × b)^n = a^n × b^n 🔄

When raising a product to a power, raise each factor to that power.

**Examples**:
- (2 × 3)⁴ = 2⁴ × 3⁴ = 16 × 81 = 1296
- (x × y)³ = x³ × y³
- (2√3)² = 2² × (√3)² = 4 × 3 = 12

**Real-life application**: A square field with side length 3×4 meters has area (3×4)² = 3² × 4² = 9 × 16 = 144 square meters.

### 5. Power of a Quotient Law: (a/b)^n = a^n/b^n 🔄

When raising a quotient to a power, raise both numerator and denominator to that power.

**Examples**:
- (2/3)³ = 2³/3³ = 8/27
- (x/y)⁴ = x⁴/y⁴
- (√2/5)² = (√2)²/5² = 2/25

**Real-life application**: If a car travels twice as far as a bicycle in one hour, after 3 hours, the ratio of distances would be (2/1)³ = 2³/1³ = 8/1.

## Understanding Zero and Negative Exponents 🧠

### Zero Exponent: a⁰ = 1 (where a ≠ 0) 🔢

Any non-zero number raised to the power of zero equals 1.

**Examples**:
- 5⁰ = 1
- (-3)⁰ = 1
- (2/7)⁰ = 1
- π⁰ = 1

This rule follows from the quotient law: a^m ÷ a^m = a^(m-m) = a⁰ = 1

### Negative Exponent: a^(-n) = 1/a^n (where a ≠ 0) 🔢

A negative exponent means taking the reciprocal of the base raised to the absolute value of the exponent.

**Examples**:
- 2⁻³ = 1/2³ = 1/8 = 0.125
- 10⁻² = 1/10² = 1/100 = 0.01
- x⁻⁵ = 1/x⁵

Alternatively, this can be written as: a^(-n) = (1/a)^n

**Real-life application**: If an asset depreciates by half each year, after 3 years its value would be 2⁻³ = 1/2³ = 1/8 of the original value.

## Fractional Exponents 🔍

Fractional exponents represent roots:
- a^(1/n) = ⁿ√a (the nth root of a)
- a^(m/n) = ⁿ√(a^m) = (ⁿ√a)^m

**Examples**:
- 8^(1/3) = ³√8 = 2
- 16^(1/2) = √16 = 4
- 27^(2/3) = (³√27)² = 3² = 9
- 4^(3/2) = (√4)³ = 2³ = 8

The laws of exponents apply to fractional exponents too!

## Simplifying Expressions with Laws of Exponents 🔧

Let's see how to apply these laws to simplify complex expressions:

**Example 1**: Simplify (2³ × 2⁵) ÷ 2⁴
Solution:
- (2³ × 2⁵) ÷ 2⁴ = 2³⁺⁵ ÷ 2⁴ = 2⁸ ÷ 2⁴ = 2⁸⁻⁴ = 2⁴ = 16

**Example 2**: Simplify (3⁴ × 3⁻² × 3⁰) × 3²
Solution:
- (3⁴ × 3⁻² × 3⁰) × 3² = 3⁴⁺(⁻²)⁺⁰ × 3² = 3² × 3² = 3²⁺² = 3⁴ = 81

**Example 3**: Simplify (2⁵ × 3⁴) ÷ (2³ × 3²)
Solution:
- (2⁵ × 3⁴) ÷ (2³ × 3²) = (2⁵ ÷ 2³) × (3⁴ ÷ 3²) = 2⁵⁻³ × 3⁴⁻² = 2² × 3² = 4 × 9 = 36

## Standard Form and Scientific Notation 🔬

The laws of exponents are particularly useful in scientific notation, where numbers are expressed as:
a × 10^n where 1 ≤ a < 10 and n is an integer.

**Examples**:
- 5,280 = 5.28 × 10³
- 0.00034 = 3.4 × 10⁻⁴

To multiply numbers in scientific notation:
(a × 10^m) × (b × 10^n) = (a × b) × 10^(m+n)

**Example**: (3 × 10⁵) × (2 × 10⁻³) = 6 × 10⁵⁻³ = 6 × 10² = 600

To divide numbers in scientific notation:
(a × 10^m) ÷ (b × 10^n) = (a ÷ b) × 10^(m-n)

**Example**: (8 × 10⁶) ÷ (4 × 10²) = 2 × 10⁶⁻² = 2 × 10⁴ = 20,000

## Sample Questions and Examples ❓

**Example 1**: Simplify (2⁻³ × 2⁵) ÷ 2⁻²
**Answer**:
- (2⁻³ × 2⁵) ÷ 2⁻² = 2⁻³⁺⁵ ÷ 2⁻² = 2² ÷ 2⁻² = 2²⁻(⁻²) = 2²⁺² = 2⁴ = 16

**Example 2**: Simplify (√2)⁸ × (√2)⁻⁶
**Answer**:
- (√2)⁸ × (√2)⁻⁶ = (2^(1/2))⁸ × (2^(1/2))⁻⁶ = 2^(8/2) × 2^(-6/2) = 2⁴ × 2⁻³ = 2⁴⁺(⁻³) = 2¹ = 2

**Example 3**: If a = 2 and b = 3, find the value of (a²b)³ ÷ (ab²)²
**Answer**:
- (a²b)³ ÷ (ab²)² = (2² × 3)³ ÷ (2 × 3²)² = (4 × 3)³ ÷ (2 × 9)²
- = 12³ ÷ 18² = 1728 ÷ 324 = 5.333...
- Alternatively using laws of exponents:
- (a²b)³ ÷ (ab²)² = a^(2×3) × b^(1×3) ÷ [a^(1×2) × b^(2×2)]
- = a⁶ × b³ ÷ [a² × b⁴] = a⁶⁻² × b³⁻⁴ = a⁴ × b⁻¹
- = 2⁴ × 3⁻¹ = 16 × (1/3) = 16/3 = 5.333...

**Example 4**: Express 0.00000723 in scientific notation
**Answer**: 0.00000723 = 7.23 × 10⁻⁶
