# Operations on Real Numbers 🧮

Now that we understand what real numbers are, let's explore how to perform mathematical operations with them. Whether we're working with rational or irrational numbers, understanding these operations is key to solving problems in mathematics and real life. 🚀

## Basic Operations on Real Numbers ➕➖✖️➗

All four basic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—can be performed on real numbers. However, the results have interesting properties depending on the types of numbers involved.

## Closure Property 🔄

The set of real numbers (ℝ) is **closed** under the four basic operations:
- If a and b are real numbers, then a + b, a - b, a × b, and a ÷ b (where b ≠ 0) are also real numbers.

This means whenever we perform these operations on real numbers, the result stays within the real number system.

## Operations with Rational and Irrational Numbers 🔍

Let's examine what happens when we perform operations with different types of real numbers:

### 1. Operations with Rational Numbers Only

When we perform operations on rational numbers only, the results follow these rules:
- Addition: Rational + Rational = Rational
- Subtraction: Rational - Rational = Rational
- Multiplication: Rational × Rational = Rational
- Division: Rational ÷ Rational = Rational (if divisor ≠ 0)

**Example**: 3/4 + 2/3 = (9 + 8)/12 = 17/12 (a rational number)

### 2. Operations Involving Irrational Numbers

The results become more complex when irrational numbers are involved:

- **Addition/Subtraction**:
  * Rational + Irrational = Irrational
  * Irrational + Irrational = Could be either rational or irrational

- **Multiplication/Division**:
  * Rational × Irrational = Irrational (if rational ≠ 0)
  * Irrational × Irrational = Could be either rational or irrational

**Examples**:
- 5 + √2 is irrational
- π × √2 is irrational
- π - π = 0 (a rational result from irrational operands!)
- √2 × √2 = 2 (a rational result from irrational operands!)

## Properties of Real Number Operations 📝

Real numbers follow important algebraic properties that help us manipulate expressions and solve equations:

### 1. Commutative Property
- Addition: a + b = b + a
- Multiplication: a × b = b × a

**Example**: 3 + π = π + 3

### 2. Associative Property
- Addition: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
- Multiplication: (a × b) × c = a × (b × c)

**Example**: (2 + √3) + 5 = 2 + (√3 + 5)

### 3. Distributive Property
- a × (b + c) = a × b + a × c

**Example**: 3 × (2 + √5) = 3 × 2 + 3 × √5 = 6 + 3√5

### 4. Identity Properties
- Additive Identity: a + 0 = a
- Multiplicative Identity: a × 1 = a

### 5. Inverse Properties
- Additive Inverse: a + (-a) = 0
- Multiplicative Inverse: a × (1/a) = 1 (where a ≠ 0)

## Working with Mixed Operations 🔢

When evaluating expressions with multiple operations, follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):
1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

**Example**: Evaluate 2 + 3 × √4 - 1
1. Simplify √4 = 2
2. 2 + 3 × 2 - 1
3. 2 + 6 - 1
4. 8 - 1
5. 7

## Adding and Subtracting Irrational Numbers 📊

When adding or subtracting irrational numbers, we often express the answer in simplified form:

**Example**: Simplify 2√3 + 5√3
- Applying distributive property: (2 + 5)√3 = 7√3

**Example**: Simplify √2 + 3√2 - √5
- Group like terms: (1 + 3)√2 - √5 = 4√2 - √5
- This cannot be simplified further as √2 and √5 are different irrational numbers

## Multiplying Irrational Numbers 🔄

When multiplying irrational expressions, we use algebraic properties:

**Example**: Simplify √2 × √8
- √(2 × 8) = √16 = 4

**Example**: Simplify √3 × √6
- √(3 × 6) = √18 = √(9 × 2) = 3√2

## Rationalizing Denominators 💡

When we have irrational numbers in the denominator, we often "rationalize" the denominator to simplify the expression:

**Example**: Simplify 1/√2
1. Multiply numerator and denominator by √2:
   1/√2 × √2/√2 = √2/2

**Example**: Simplify 3/(2 + √3)
1. Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 - √3):
   3/(2 + √3) × (2 - √3)/(2 - √3) = 3(2 - √3)/[(2)² - (√3)²] = 3(2 - √3)/(4 - 3) = 3(2 - √3)/1 = 6 - 3√3

## Operations with Decimal Expansions 🔢

When performing operations with decimal expansions:

- For **terminating decimals**, perform standard decimal arithmetic:
  **Example**: 0.25 + 1.75 = 2.00

- For **repeating decimals**, either:
  * Convert to fractions, perform the operation, then convert back
  * Perform decimal arithmetic with appropriate techniques for repeating decimals
  
  **Example**: 0.333... + 0.666... = 1/3 + 2/3 = 3/3 = 1

- For **irrational decimals**, use approximations when calculating:
  **Example**: π + √2 ≈ 3.14159 + 1.41421 ≈ 4.5558

## Approximation and Exact Values ⚖️

In practical applications, we often need to decide between:

1. **Exact form**: Keeping expressions like 2 + √3 or π/4 in their exact mathematical form
2. **Decimal approximation**: Converting to decimal approximations like 3.732... or 0.785...

The choice depends on the context:
- Theoretical mathematics: Prefer exact form
- Applied calculations: Often use decimal approximations
- Educational contexts: Both forms help build understanding

## Sample Questions and Examples ❓

**Example 1**: Simplify √12 + √27
**Answer**: 
√12 = √(4 × 3) = 2√3
√27 = √(9 × 3) = 3√3
√12 + √27 = 2√3 + 3√3 = 5√3

**Example 2**: Is √7 + √7 rational or irrational?
**Answer**: √7 + √7 = 2√7, which is irrational because 2√7 cannot be expressed as a ratio of integers.

**Example 3**: Simplify (3 + √5)(2 - √5)
**Answer**: Using the distributive property:
(3 + √5)(2 - √5) = 3(2) - 3(√5) + √5(2) - √5(√5)
= 6 - 3√5 + 2√5 - 5
= 6 - 5 + 2√5 - 3√5
= 1 - √5

**Example 4**: Rationalize the denominator: 5/(√6 - √2)
**Answer**: Multiply both numerator and denominator by (√6 + √2):
5/(√6 - √2) × (√6 + √2)/(√6 + √2) = 5(√6 + √2)/[(√6)² - (√2)²] = 5(√6 + √2)/(6 - 2) = 5(√6 + √2)/4 = (5√6 + 5√2)/4
