        question: "Which of these sets has the largest cardinality (size)?",
        options: [
            "The set of natural numbers",
            "The set of rational numbers",

            "All have the same cardinality"
        ],
        correctAnswer: "The set of irrational numbers",
        explanation: "The set of irrational numbers has a larger cardinality than the sets of natural numbers and rational numbers. While natural and rational numbers are both countably infinite (‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ), irrational numbers are uncountably infinite (have the cardinality of the continuum, 2^‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ). This was proven by Cantor's diagonal argument. üî¢",
        wrongAnswerExplanations: {
            "The set of natural numbers": "Natural numbers are countably infinite, which is a smaller infinity than that of irrational numbers.",
            "The set of rational numbers": "Rational numbers are countably infinite, which is a smaller infinity than that of irrational numbers.",
            "All have the same cardinality": "This is incorrect. Irrational numbers have a strictly larger cardinality than natural or rational numbers."

        question: "Approximating irrational numbers like œÄ to a fixed number of decimal places makes them:",

        ],
        correctAnswer: "Rational",
        explanation: "Approximating an irrational number to a fixed number of decimal places creates a rational number. For example, approximating œÄ as 3.14 creates the rational number 314/100. Any terminated decimal is rational. This is why we can never represent irrational numbers exactly in decimal form - we can only approximate them. üîç",
        wrongAnswerExplanations: {
            "Exact": "This is incorrect. An approximation is never exact by definition.",
            "Still irrational": "This is incorrect. A terminated decimal is always rational, not irrational.",
            "Integers": "This is incorrect. Approximations with decimal places are not integers."
