    explanation: 'When a diagonal of a parallelogram bisects the angles it connects (in this case, angles A and C), the parallelogram is a rhombus.

    explanation: 'A quadrilateral with all sides equal is a rhombus. For a rhombus to become a square, all angles must be equal (which means they all equal 90¬∞). The condition that diagonals bisect each other is already satisfied by a rhombus, and having just one right angle is not sufficient for a square. Equal diagonals would make it a square, but the most direct condition is that all angles are equal. üü¶',
    wrongAnswerExplanations: {
      'Diagonals bisect each other': 'This is incorrect. Diagonals already bisect each other in a rhombus, so this doesn\'t add the additional property needed to make it a square.',
      'One angle is 90¬∞': 'This is insufficient. For a quadrilateral to be a square, all four angles must be 90¬∞, not just one.',
      'Diagonals are equal in length': 'While this would make a rhombus a square, the most direct condition stated is that all angles are equal.'
