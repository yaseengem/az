        explanation: "Disease spread is heavily influenced by individual movement and social network structures. Ignoring these variations can significantly reduce model accuracy, as 'super-spreader' events and local clusters often drive epidemics. ü¶†",

        question: "What does it mean when a mathematical model is described as 'robust'?",

            "It produces exactly perfect predictions",

        ],
        correctAnswer: "It continues to provide reasonable results even with small changes in assumptions or inputs",
        explanation: "A robust model maintains reasonable predictive power despite minor variations in inputs or assumptions. This important quality shows the model captures fundamental relationships rather than being overfitted to specific conditions. ‚ö°",
