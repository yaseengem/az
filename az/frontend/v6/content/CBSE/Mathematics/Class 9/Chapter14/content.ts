# Appendix: Introduction to Mathematical Modelling

This chapter introduces students to the concept of mathematical modelling and its applications. Students will learn about:
1. Introduction to mathematical modelling and its importance
2. Review of word problems and their translation into mathematical language
3. Examples of mathematical models in different contexts
4. The process of creating mathematical models, with their advantages and limitations
5. Summary of key concepts and techniques

The chapter builds essential problem-solving skills by connecting abstract mathematical concepts to real-world situations, preparing students for practical applications of mathematics.`,
