        correctAnswer: "When the available data is limited and cannot support the added complexity",
        explanation: "Adding complexity without sufficient data to properly calibrate and validate the model can lead to overfitting, where the model matches existing data well but performs poorly with new data due to capturing noise rather than true patterns. üìâ",

        correctAnswer: "When predicting growth in a densely populated area with resource constraints",
        explanation: "The model assumes unlimited resources, but in densely populated areas, resource limitations (food, water, space) create carrying capacities that slow growth. The model would fail to account for these density-dependent factors, leading to unrealistic predictions. üå±",

        correctAnswer: "The model is especially sensitive to this parameter and requires careful calibration",
        explanation: "High sensitivity to a parameter suggests that small estimation errors can lead to significantly different outcomes.

        correctAnswer: "The model was based on historical data that didn't reflect future economic conditions",
        explanation: "Financial models often assume that past patterns will continue, but economic conditions change. The discrepancy likely stems from changes in market conditions, economic policies, or other factors that weren't represented in the historical data used to build the model. üíπ",

        ],
        correctAnswer: "Abandon modelling climate altogether",
        explanation: "Model failures provide valuable learning opportunities to refine our understanding.

        correctAnswer: "Problem formulation and identifying key variables",
        explanation: "Problem formulation requires deep understanding of both the subject domain (to identify relevant factors) and mathematical techniques (to determine appropriate representation). This essential step demands collaboration between subject experts and mathematicians to create a valid model. ü§ù",

        ],
        correctAnswer: "Verification checks the model's mathematics while validation tests against real-world data",
        explanation: "Verification ensures the model is correctly implemented (answering 'Did we build the model right?'), while validation tests whether the model adequately represents reality (answering 'Did we build the right model?'). Both are essential but distinct quality checks. ‚úì",

        correctAnswer: "Models can inform policy decisions but should be one of several inputs",
        explanation: "While models provide valuable insights for policy-making, they should complement other inputs like expert judgment, ethical considerations, and stakeholder perspectives. No model captures all relevant factors, especially those that are difficult to quantify. üìã",

        correctAnswer: "The model is applied to situations very different from what it was designed for",
        explanation: "Models are designed with specific purposes and contexts in mind. Applying a model to significantly different situations (extrapolation beyond its valid domain) without proper adaptation can lead to highly misleading results and is a common form of model misuse. ‚ö†Ô∏è",

        ],
        correctAnswer: "Clearly specify the age range for which the model is valid and develop separate models for other groups",
        explanation: "When a model works well only for specific cases, its domain of validity should be clearly defined. Different physiological factors affect drug metabolism in children and elderly patients, likely requiring separate specialized models for those populations. üíä",

        ],
        correctAnswer: "It contains too many variables and captures noise in the data rather than underlying patterns",
        explanation: "An overfitted model matches training data extremely well by adapting to random noise or fluctuations specific to that dataset. While it performs well on existing data, it typically performs poorly on new data because it captured peculiarities rather than general patterns. üìâ",
