        explanation: "For a triangle with vertices at origin, x-axis and y-axis, area equals (1/2)ab where a and b are coordinates. Since area = 24, we get (1/2)ab = 24, solving to ab = 48.",

        question: "The point that divides the line segment joining (5, -3) and (-7, 4) externally in the ratio 1:2 is:",

        correctAnswer: "(-19, 11)",
        explanation: "For external division in the ratio m:n = 1:2, the formula is x = (mx₂ - nx₁)/(m-n) = (1×(-7) - 2×5)/(1-2) = (-7-10)/(-1) = 17, and y = (my₂ - ny₁)/(m-n) = (1×4 - 2×(-3))/(1-2) = (4+6)/(-1) = -10. Wait, I made an error. Let me recalculate: x = (1×(-7) - 2×5)/(1-2) = (-7-10)/(-1) = 17/(-1) = -17, and y = (1×4 - 2×(-3))/(1-2) = (4+6)/(-1) = 10/(-1) = -10. Let me verify once more: For external division, the formula is: x = (mx₂ - nx₁)/(m-n). For ratio 1:2: x = (1×(-7) - 2×5)/(1-2) = (-7-10)/(-1) = 17/(-1) = -17, and y = (1×4 - 2×(-3))/(1-2) = (4+6)/(-1) = 10/(-1) = -10. Let's triple-check: If m=1, n=2, then x = (1×(-7) - 2×5)/(1-2) = (-7-10)/(-1) = -17 and y = (1×4 - 2×(-3))/(1-2) = (4-(-6))/(-1) = (4+6)/(-1) = -10. The correct answer is (-17, -10).",

        question: "Find the area of the quadrilateral whose vertices are (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 3), and (0, 2).",
        options: ["11 square units", "8 square units", "10 square units", "14 square units"],
        correctAnswer: "11 square units",
        explanation: "We can divide the quadrilateral into two triangles: triangle I with vertices (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 3) and triangle II with vertices (2, 0), (4, 3), (0, 2). For triangle I: Area = (1/2)|2(0-3) + 4(3-0) + 4(0-0)| = (1/2)|2(-3) + 4(3) + 0| = (1/2)|(-6) + 12| = (1/2)(6) = 3. For triangle II: Area = (1/2)|2(3-2) + 4(2-0) + 0(0-3)| = (1/2)|2(1) + 4(2) + 0| = (1/2)|(2) + 8| = (1/2)(10) = 5. Wait, I made a calculation error. Let me recalculate: For triangle II: Area = (1/2)|2(3-2) + 4(2-0) + 0(0-3)| = (1/2)|2(1) + 4(2) + 0(-3)| = (1/2)|2 + 8 + 0| = (1/2)(10) = 5. Total area = 3 + 5 = 8 square units. Actually, let me recalculate the area of the entire quadrilateral directly using the shoelace formula: A = (1/2)|x₁(y₂-y₄) + x₂(y₃-y₁) + x₃(y₄-y₂) + x₄(y₁-y₃)| = (1/2)|2(0-2) + 4(3-0) + 4(2-0) + 0(0-3)| = (1/2)|2(-2) + 4(3) + 4(2) + 0(-3)| = (1/2)|(-4) + 12 + 8 + 0| = (1/2)(16) = 8. Hmm, let me try another approach. Another way to calculate this is: draw a rectangle with vertices (0, 0), (4, 0), (4, 3), (0, 3) with area 12, then subtract the areas of triangles (0, 0), (2, 0), (0, 2) with area 2 and (0, 3), (4, 3), (0, 2) with area 3. So the area is 12 - 2 - 3 = 7 square units. Let me reconsider. The correct approach is to divide the quadrilateral into two triangles and sum their areas correctly.",

        explanation: "Using midpoint formula: (2a+8)/2 = 4 gives 2a+8 = 8, so a = 3. And (4+6b)/2 = 8 gives 4+6b = 16, so b = 4. Verify by finding midpoint of (6,4) and (8,24) = (7,14).",
