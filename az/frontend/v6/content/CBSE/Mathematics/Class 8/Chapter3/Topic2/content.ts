# Properties of Parallelograms, Rectangles, Rhombus, and Square üü´‚¨õ‚¨ú

Understanding the properties of different quadrilaterals is essential in geometry. In this topic, we will focus on four important types: parallelogram, rectangle, rhombus, and square. Each has unique properties that help us solve problems and recognize shapes in real life.

## Parallelogram üü´
A parallelogram is a quadrilateral with both pairs of opposite sides parallel.

### Key Properties:
- Opposite sides are equal and parallel.
- Opposite angles are equal.
- Adjacent angles are supplementary (sum to 180¬∞).
- Diagonals bisect each other.

### Example:
A slanted window frame or a diamond-shaped road sign is often a parallelogram.

### Sample Question:
If one angle of a parallelogram is 70¬∞, what is the measure of its adjacent angle? (Answer: 110¬∞, since adjacent angles are supplementary.)

## Rectangle ‚¨õ
A rectangle is a parallelogram with all angles equal to 90¬∞.

### Key Properties:
- Opposite sides are equal and parallel.
- All angles are right angles (90¬∞).
- Diagonals are equal in length and bisect each other.
- Each diagonal divides the rectangle into two congruent triangles.

### Example:
A book, a door, or a mobile phone screen is usually rectangular.

### Sample Question:
A rectangle has a length of 8 cm and a width of 5 cm. What is the length of its diagonal? (Answer: 9.43 cm, using the Pythagorean theorem: ‚àö(8¬≤ + 5¬≤) = ‚àö89 ‚âà 9.43)

## Rhombus üî∑
A rhombus is a parallelogram with all sides equal in length.

### Key Properties:
- All sides are equal.
- Opposite angles are equal.
- Diagonals bisect each other at right angles (90¬∞).
- Diagonals are not equal but cut each other into two equal halves.

### Example:
A diamond shape on playing cards or certain decorative tiles is a rhombus.

### Sample Question:
If the diagonals of a rhombus are 10 cm and 24 cm, what is its area? (Answer: 120 cm¬≤, since area = (d1 √ó d2) / 2 = (10 √ó 24) / 2 = 120)

## Square ‚¨ú
A square is a rectangle with all sides equal, or a rhombus with all angles equal to 90¬∞.

### Key Properties:
- All sides are equal.
- All angles are right angles (90¬∞).
- Diagonals are equal, bisect each other at right angles, and are perpendicular.
- Each diagonal divides the square into two congruent isosceles right triangles.

### Example:
A chessboard square or a sticky note is a square.

### Sample Question:
What is the perimeter of a square with side 7 cm? (Answer: 28 cm, since perimeter = 4 √ó side = 4 √ó 7 = 28)

## Comparing the Four Quadrilaterals üîç
| Property         | Parallelogram | Rectangle | Rhombus | Square |
|------------------|--------------|-----------|---------|--------|
| Opposite sides   | Equal        | Equal     | Equal   | Equal  |
| Opposite angles  | Equal        | Equal     | Equal   | Equal  |
| All angles 90¬∞   | No           | Yes       | No      | Yes    |
| All sides equal  | No           | No        | Yes     | Yes    |
| Diagonals equal  | No           | Yes       | No      | Yes    |
| Diagonals bisect | Yes          | Yes       | Yes     | Yes    |
| Diagonals ‚üÇ     | No           | No        | Yes     | Yes    |

## Real-Life Applications üåç
- **Architecture:** Windows, tiles, and floor plans use these shapes for strength and design.
- **Art:** Patterns and designs often use squares, rectangles, and rhombuses.
- **Sports:** Fields and courts (like football and tennis) are rectangles.

## Practice Questions üìù
1. Which quadrilateral has all sides equal and all angles right angles? (Answer: Square)
2. In a parallelogram, if one side is 6 cm, what is the length of the opposite side? (Answer: 6 cm)
3. What is the sum of the angles in any quadrilateral? (Answer: 360¬∞)
4. Which quadrilateral has diagonals that bisect each other at right angles but are not equal? (Answer: Rhombus)
5. Give an example of a rectangle from daily life. (Answer: Book, door, mobile screen, etc.)

## Summary ‚ú®
- Parallelogram: Opposite sides and angles equal, diagonals bisect each other.
- Rectangle: Parallelogram with all angles 90¬∞, diagonals equal.
- Rhombus: Parallelogram with all sides equal, diagonals perpendicular.
- Square: All sides and angles equal, diagonals equal and perpendicular.

Recognizing these properties helps in geometry, real life, and problem-solving. Keep practicing to master these quadrilaterals! üí™
