        question: "If all acute angles are less than 90¬∞, and angle LMN is 90¬∞, what can you conclude?",
        options: [
            "Angle LMN is not acute",
            "Angle LMN is acute",
            "Angle LMN might be acute",
            "Cannot determine if LMN is acute"
        ],
        correctAnswer: "Angle LMN is not acute",
        explanation: "Using direct reasoning: if all acute angles are less than 90¬∞ and LMN is 90¬∞, then LMN cannot be acute. üìê",
