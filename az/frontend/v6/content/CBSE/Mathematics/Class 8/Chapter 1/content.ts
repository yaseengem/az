# Rational Numbers ðŸ”¢

This chapter covers fundamental concepts of rational numbers and their operations. Students will learn:

1. Properties of rational numbers including:
   - Closure property
   - Commutative property
   - Associative property
   - Distributive property
   - Additive and multiplicative identity
   - Additive and multiplicative inverse

2. Operations on rational numbers:
   - Addition and subtraction
   - Multiplication and division
   - Finding reciprocals
   - Solving word problems

3. Representation on number line:
   - Plotting positive and negative rational numbers
   - Understanding density property
   - Comparing rational numbers

The chapter builds a strong foundation for working with real numbers and algebraic expressions in higher grades.`,
