        explanation: "Distribute: 2x - 6 + 3x + 6 - x + 1. Combine like terms: (2 + 3 - 1)x + (-6 + 6 + 1) = 4x - 3. Pay attention to signs when combining. ðŸ§®",

        correctAnswer: "No solution",
        explanation: "Subtract x/2 from both sides: 3 = 5. This is a false statement, so the equation has no solution. The constants differ but the variable terms are identical. ðŸš«",
