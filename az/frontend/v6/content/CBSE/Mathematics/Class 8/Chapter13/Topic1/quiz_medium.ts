        correctAnswer: "Use a dual y-axis",
        explanation: "A dual y-axis allows plotting of variables with different scales (mm for rainfall, ¬∞C for temperature, % for humidity) on the same graph while maintaining accuracy. üìà",

            "Use the same scale for all": "Different units can't use the same scale meaningfully.",
