        question: "If all parallelograms have parallel opposite sides, and all rectangles are parallelograms, what can you conclude about rectangles?",
        options: [
            "They have parallel opposite sides",
            "They have non-parallel opposite sides",
            "Some opposite sides might be parallel",
            "Cannot determine about opposite sides"
        ],
        correctAnswer: "They have parallel opposite sides",
        explanation: "Using transitive property: if rectangle‚Üíparallelogram and parallelogram‚Üíparallel opposite sides, then rectangle‚Üíparallel opposite sides. üìè",
        wrongAnswerExplanations: {
            "They have non-parallel opposite sides": "This contradicts the logical conclusion.",
            "Some opposite sides might be parallel": "We can definitively say all opposite sides are parallel.",
            "Cannot determine about opposite sides": "We can determine using transitive property."
