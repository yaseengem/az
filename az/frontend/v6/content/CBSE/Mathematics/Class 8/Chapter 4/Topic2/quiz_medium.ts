        question: "A double bar graph compares the annual rainfall (in cm) in two cities over 5 years. The mean rainfall for City A is 75 cm and for City B is 60 cm. If the bars for City A are higher than City B in 3 out of 5 years, which of the following could be true?",
        options: [
            "City A had more than 75 cm rainfall every year",
            "City B had less than 60 cm rainfall every year",
            "In the years where City B had more rainfall, the difference was greater than in the years where City A had more",
            "The rainfall was exactly the same in both cities for one of the years"
        ],
        correctAnswer: "In the years where City B had more rainfall, the difference was greater than in the years where City A had more",
        explanation: "For City A to have a higher mean (75 cm vs 60 cm) despite having higher rainfall in only 3 of 5 years, the years where City B had more rainfall must have had smaller differences than the years where City A had more. This balances to give City A the higher overall mean. ‚òî",
        wrongAnswerExplanations: {
            "City A had more than 75 cm rainfall every year": "City A could have had below-average rainfall in some years.",
            "City B had less than 60 cm rainfall every year": "City B could have had above-average rainfall in some years.",
            "The rainfall was exactly the same in both cities for one of the years": "This would leave only one year where City B had more rainfall, not two."

        question: "The following table shows the marks distribution of 200 students: 0-20 marks (15 students), 21-40 marks (45 students), 41-60 marks (70 students), 61-80 marks (50 students), 81-100 marks (20 students). If this data is represented in both a pie chart and a bar graph, which of the following would be true?",
        options: [
            "The bar for 41-60 marks would be the tallest and its sector in the pie chart would be the largest",
            "The pie chart would have equal sectors as the marks ranges are equal",
            "The bar for 0-20 marks would be shortest but its sector wouldn't be the smallest in the pie chart",
            "The bar graph would show percentages while the pie chart would show the number of students"
        ],
        correctAnswer: "The bar for 41-60 marks would be the tallest and its sector in the pie chart would be the largest",
        explanation: "The interval 41-60 marks has 70 students, the highest frequency. This would create both the tallest bar in the bar graph and the largest sector (occupying 70/200 = 35% of the pie) in the pie chart. üìä",
        wrongAnswerExplanations: {
            "The pie chart would have equal sectors as the marks ranges are equal": "The sectors represent frequencies, not the width of intervals.",
            "The bar for 0-20 marks would be shortest but its sector wouldn't be the smallest in the pie chart": "The interval 0-20 has the fewest students (15), so it would have both the shortest bar and smallest sector.",
            "The bar graph would show percentages while the pie chart would show the number of students": "Both graphs represent the same data; the bar graph typically shows frequencies while the pie chart shows percentages."
