## Division Algorithm for Polynomials

The **Division Algorithm for Polynomials** is a method that allows us to divide a polynomial \( p(x) \) by another polynomial \( g(x) \) (where \( g(x) \) is not zero), and express the result in a specific form. This algorithm is essential for simplifying complex polynomial expressions, finding polynomial roots, and is widely used in algebra and calculus.

### The Algorithm

Given two polynomials, the dividend \( p(x) \) and the divisor \( g(x) \), the division algorithm states that we can find another polynomial \( q(x) \) (the quotient) and a remainder \( r(x) \) such that:

\[
p(x) = g(x) \times q(x) + r(x)
\]

where the degree of the remainder \( r(x) \) is less than the degree of the divisor \( g(x) \).

### Steps for Polynomial Long Division

1. **Divide**: Divide the highest degree term of the dividend by the highest degree term of the divisor.
2. **Multiply**: Multiply the entire divisor by the result from the divide step.
3. **Subtract**: Subtract the result of the multiplication from the dividend.
4. **Repeat**: Repeat the process with the new polynomial (remainder) until the degree of the remainder is less than the degree of the divisor.

### Synthetic Division

Synthetic division is a simplified form of polynomial long division. It's used when the divisor is a linear polynomial of the form \( x - c \). The process involves:
- Writing the coefficients of the dividend.
- Using the zero of the divisor (i.e., \( c \)) in a modified long division process.
- The result gives the coefficients of the quotient, with the remainder being the last term.

### Remainder Theorem

The remainder theorem states that if a polynomial \( p(x) \) is divided by \( x - a \), the remainder of this division is \( p(a) \). This theorem provides a quick way to evaluate polynomials and find remainders.

### Factor Theorem

The factor theorem is a special case of the remainder theorem. It states that \( (x - a) \) is a factor of the polynomial \( p(x) \) if and only if \( p(a) = 0 \). This theorem is fundamental in finding polynomial roots and factoring polynomials.

### Applications

The division algorithm for polynomials helps us to:
1. Find factors of polynomials
2. Evaluate polynomial values
3. Solve polynomial equations
4. Express complex fractions in simpler forms

## Summary ✨

The **Division Algorithm for Polynomials** is a fundamental concept that extends the idea of division from arithmetic to algebra. It provides the structure:

p(x) = g(x) × q(x) + r(x), where degree of r(x) < degree of g(x).

We've explored:
- **Long Division and Synthetic Division** methods for polynomial division 🧮
- **Remainder Theorem**: When p(x) is divided by x - a, the remainder equals p(a) 🔍
- **Factor Theorem**: (x - a) is a factor of p(x) if and only if p(a) = 0 🧩
- **Applications** in finding factors, evaluating polynomials, and solving equations 📝

Understanding polynomial division is crucial for solving more complex problems in algebra and calculus. Like building blocks, this algorithm forms the foundation for many advanced mathematical techniques. 🏗️

### Practice Problems 📚

1. Find the quotient and remainder when 2x³ - 3x² + 4x - 5 is divided by x - 3.

2. If (x - 2) is a factor of p(x) = x³ - 3x² + kx - 2, find the value of k.

3. Find the remainder when p(x) = x⁷ - x⁵ + 3 is divided by x + 2.

4. If the remainder when p(x) is divided by x - 3 is 10 and the remainder when divided by x + 2 is 5, find the remainder when p(x) is divided by (x - 3)(x + 2).

5. Find a quadratic polynomial whose remainder when divided by (x - 1) is 3, by (x - 2) is 5, and by (x - 3) is 7.
