# Similarity of Triangles üåü

Similar triangles are a fundamental concept in geometry that helps us solve many real-world problems! üìè‚ú® In this topic, we'll explore what makes triangles similar, how to identify similar triangles, and how to use similarity to find unknown measurements. Let's dive into this fascinating geometric relationship! üöÄ

## What Does "Similar Triangles" Mean? ü§î

Two triangles are **similar** when they have the **same shape** but potentially different sizes. More precisely:

- Their corresponding angles are **equal**
- Their corresponding sides are **proportional**

Think of similar triangles as photocopies of each other that might have been enlarged or reduced. üì∏

### Key Notation

When triangles ABC and DEF are similar, we write:
- ‚ñ≥ABC ~ ‚ñ≥DEF (the ~ symbol means "similar to")

When writing about corresponding parts, we list vertices in the same order:
- A corresponds to D
- B corresponds to E
- C corresponds to F

So the corresponding sides are: AB and DE, BC and EF, AC and DF.

## Criteria for Similarity of Triangles üìã

We don't need to check all angles and sides to determine if triangles are similar. The following criteria are sufficient:

### 1. Angle-Angle (AA) Criterion üìê

**Statement**: If two angles of one triangle are equal to two angles of another triangle, then the triangles are similar.

**Why it works**: Since the sum of angles in any triangle is 180¬∞, if two angles are equal, the third must be equal too.

**Example**:
- In ‚ñ≥ABC, if ‚à†A = 50¬∞ and ‚à†B = 60¬∞, then ‚à†C = 70¬∞
- In ‚ñ≥PQR, if ‚à†P = 50¬∞ and ‚à†Q = 60¬∞, then ‚à†R = 70¬∞
- Since two angles match, ‚ñ≥ABC ~ ‚ñ≥PQR by the AA criterion

**Note**: Sometimes this is called the AAA criterion, but since the third angle is determined by the first two, AA is sufficient.

### 2. Side-Angle-Side (SAS) Similarity Criterion üìè

**Statement**: If the ratio of two sides of one triangle equals the ratio of two corresponding sides of another triangle, and the included angles are equal, then the triangles are similar.

**Example**:
- In ‚ñ≥ABC and ‚ñ≥DEF, if:
  * AB/DE = AC/DF
  * ‚à†A = ‚à†D
- Then ‚ñ≥ABC ~ ‚ñ≥DEF by the SAS similarity criterion

### 3. Side-Side-Side (SSS) Similarity Criterion üìèüìèüìè

**Statement**: If the corresponding sides of two triangles are proportional, then the triangles are similar.

**Example**:
- In ‚ñ≥ABC and ‚ñ≥PQR, if:
  * AB/PQ = BC/QR = CA/RP
- Then ‚ñ≥ABC ~ ‚ñ≥PQR by the SSS similarity criterion

## Properties of Similar Triangles üîç

When triangles are similar, several relationships hold true:

### 1. Corresponding Angles Are Equal

In similar triangles ‚ñ≥ABC ~ ‚ñ≥DEF:
- ‚à†A = ‚à†D
- ‚à†B = ‚à†E
- ‚à†C = ‚à†F

### 2. Corresponding Sides Are Proportional

If ‚ñ≥ABC ~ ‚ñ≥DEF, then:
- AB/DE = BC/EF = AC/DF = k (where k is the scale factor)

### 3. Ratio of Areas

If ‚ñ≥ABC ~ ‚ñ≥DEF with a scale factor k for the sides, then:
- Area of ‚ñ≥ABC / Area of ‚ñ≥DEF = k¬≤

**Example**: If the sides of triangle DEF are twice as long as the corresponding sides of triangle ABC, then the area of DEF is 2¬≤ = 4 times the area of ABC.

### 4. Ratio of Perimeters

If ‚ñ≥ABC ~ ‚ñ≥DEF with a scale factor k for the sides, then:
- Perimeter of ‚ñ≥ABC / Perimeter of ‚ñ≥DEF = k

### 5. Corresponding Medians, Angle Bisectors, and Altitudes

All of these are in the same ratio as the corresponding sides.

## Basic Proportionality Theorem (Thales' Theorem) üìê

This theorem helps us identify parallel lines and establish similar triangles:

**Statement**: If a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle, it divides the other two sides proportionally.

**Mathematical form**: In ‚ñ≥ABC, if DE ‚à• BC and D is on AB, E is on AC, then:
- AD/DB = AE/EC
- Also, AB/AD = AC/AE

**Converse**: If a line divides two sides of a triangle proportionally, it is parallel to the third side.

**Example**:
- In ‚ñ≥ABC, if D is on AB, E is on AC, and AD/DB = AE/EC = 2/3, then DE ‚à• BC
- Moreover, DE/BC = 2/5 (since the ratio is AD/AB = 2/5)

## Similar Right Triangles üìê

Right triangles have special similarity properties:

1. **If an altitude is drawn from the right angle to the hypotenuse**:
   - The altitude divides the original triangle into two triangles that are both similar to the original triangle
   - If the right angle is at A and AD ‚ä• BC, then ‚ñ≥ABC ~ ‚ñ≥ADB ~ ‚ñ≥ADC

2. **Special theorem**: If AD ‚ä• BC, then:
   - AD¬≤ = BD √ó DC
   - AB¬≤ = BC √ó BD
   - AC¬≤ = BC √ó DC

These are powerful tools for solving problems involving right triangles!

## Applications of Similar Triangles üåç

Similar triangles have many practical applications:

### 1. Finding Heights Indirectly üè¢

**Example**: To find the height of a tall building:
1. Measure your height (e.g., 1.8 m)
2. Measure your shadow (e.g., 2.4 m)
3. Measure the building's shadow (e.g., 16 m)
4. Set up a proportion: 1.8/building height = 2.4/16
5. Solve: building height = 1.8 √ó 16/2.4 = 12 m

This works because the triangles formed by you and your shadow and the building and its shadow are similar.

### 2. Distance Measurement üåä

**Example**: To find the distance across a river:
1. Place markers A and C on one bank
2. Place marker B on the opposite bank, forming triangle ABC
3. Extend AC to point D such that AC = CD
4. Place marker E on the opposite bank such that CE ‚à• AB
5. Measure DE (e.g., 25 m)
6. Distance across (AB) = DE = 25 m

This works because of similar triangles created by parallel lines.

### 3. Map Scaling üó∫Ô∏è

Maps use similarity principles to represent large areas in manageable sizes while maintaining proportions. If a map has a scale of 1:10,000, a 2 cm measurement on the map represents 20,000 cm (200 m) in real life.

## Examples and Problems üìù

### Example 1: Basic Similarity
In ‚ñ≥ABC, ‚à†A = 65¬∞, ‚à†B = 45¬∞, and ‚à†C = 70¬∞.
In ‚ñ≥PQR, ‚à†P = 65¬∞, ‚à†Q = 45¬∞, and ‚à†R = 70¬∞.
Are these triangles similar? If yes, why?

**Solution**:
Yes, ‚ñ≥ABC ~ ‚ñ≥PQR by the AA similarity criterion because:
- ‚à†A = ‚à†P = 65¬∞
- ‚à†B = ‚à†Q = 45¬∞
(We don't need to check the third angle, but we can confirm ‚à†C = ‚à†R = 70¬∞)

### Example 2: Finding Unknown Side
In ‚ñ≥ABC and ‚ñ≥DEF, ‚à†A = ‚à†D, ‚à†B = ‚à†E, AB = 5 cm, AC = 7 cm, and DE = 10 cm.
Find DF.

**Solution**:
Since ‚à†A = ‚à†D and ‚à†B = ‚à†E, ‚ñ≥ABC ~ ‚ñ≥DEF by the AA criterion.
Since corresponding sides are proportional:
AB/DE = AC/DF
5/10 = 7/DF
DF = 7 √ó 10/5 = 14 cm

### Example 3: Basic Proportionality Theorem
In ‚ñ≥ABC, point D is on AB and point E is on AC such that DE ‚à• BC.
If AD = 4 cm, DB = 6 cm, and AE = 8 cm, find EC.

**Solution**:
By the Basic Proportionality Theorem:
AD/DB = AE/EC
4/6 = 8/EC
EC = 6 √ó 8/4 = 12 cm

### Example 4: Area Ratio
Two similar triangles have sides in the ratio 3:4. What is the ratio of their areas?

**Solution**:
If the ratio of corresponding sides is 3:4, then the ratio of their areas is (3:4)¬≤ = 9:16.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **Incorrect correspondence**: When identifying similar triangles, make sure you correctly match corresponding vertices.
   - In ‚ñ≥ABC ~ ‚ñ≥DEF, A corresponds to D, B to E, and C to F
   - Incorrect matching will lead to wrong conclusions

2. **Confusing similarity with congruence**: Similar triangles have the same shape but may have different sizes; congruent triangles are identical in both shape and size.

3. **Forgetting to square the ratio**: When calculating the ratio of areas of similar triangles, don't forget to square the ratio of corresponding sides.

4. **Using AAA or AAS as similarity criteria**: While AAA works (but is redundant since it reduces to AA), AAS is not a valid standalone similarity criterion.

5. **Incorrectly applying proportionality**: When using the Basic Proportionality Theorem, make sure you set up the correct proportions.

## Sample Questions ‚ùì

**Question 1**: In ‚ñ≥ABC, DE is parallel to BC with D on AB and E on AC. If AD = 3 cm, DB = 4 cm, and AE = 4.5 cm, find EC.

**Answer**: Since DE ‚à• BC, by the Basic Proportionality Theorem, AD/AB = AE/AC. 
So, AD/DB = AE/EC, which gives 3/4 = 4.5/EC. 
Solving for EC: EC = 4.5 √ó 4/3 = 6 cm.

**Question 2**: A 5-meter pole casts a 3-meter shadow. At the same time, a building casts a 36-meter shadow. How tall is the building?

**Answer**: Using similar triangles,
pole height/building height = pole shadow/building shadow
5/h = 3/36
h = 5 √ó 36/3 = 60 meters

**Question 3**: In similar triangles, if the ratio of their perimeters is 2:3, what is the ratio of their areas?

**Answer**: If the ratio of perimeters is 2:3, then the ratio of corresponding sides is also 2:3.
The ratio of areas is (2:3)¬≤ = 4:9.

### Additional Practice:

1. In ‚ñ≥ABC, if ‚à†A = 55¬∞, ‚à†B = 65¬∞, and ‚à†C = 60¬∞, is it possible to find another triangle similar to ‚ñ≥ABC? Why or why not?
