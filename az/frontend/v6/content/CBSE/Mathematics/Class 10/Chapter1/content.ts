# Real Numbers

This chapter deepens students' understanding of real numbers and their properties. Students will learn about:
1. Euclid's Division Lemma and its applications
2. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (Prime Factorization)
3. Revisiting irrational numbers and their properties
4. Rational numbers and their decimal expansions (terminating and non-terminating)

The chapter builds on previous knowledge of number systems and strengthens the foundation for advanced mathematical concepts.`,    quiz: {

                options: ["4", "6", "9", "12"],
                correctAnswer: "6",
                explanation: "Using the relation: HCF Ã— LCM = Product of the numbers. So, HCF = Product/LCM = 216/36 = 6",
