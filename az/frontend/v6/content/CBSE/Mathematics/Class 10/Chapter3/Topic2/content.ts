# Algebraic Methods for Solving Linear Equations üßÆ

Linear equations are the foundation of many mathematical problems and real-world applications. When we need to find values that satisfy two linear equations simultaneously, we use algebraic methods for solving pairs of linear equations in two variables. In this topic, we'll explore three powerful methods: substitution, elimination, and cross-multiplication. Let's dive in! üöÄ

## Standard Form of Pair of Linear Equations üìù

Before solving equations, it's helpful to express them in standard form:

a‚ÇÅx + b‚ÇÅy + c‚ÇÅ = 0
a‚ÇÇx + b‚ÇÇy + c‚ÇÇ = 0

Where a‚ÇÅ, b‚ÇÅ, c‚ÇÅ, a‚ÇÇ, b‚ÇÇ, c‚ÇÇ are real numbers and a‚ÇÅ, b‚ÇÅ, a‚ÇÇ, b‚ÇÇ are not all zero.

## Method 1: Substitution Method üîÅ

The substitution method involves expressing one variable in terms of the other from one equation and then substituting this expression into the second equation.

### Steps for Substitution Method:
1. Choose one equation (preferably the simpler one) and express one variable in terms of the other.
2. Substitute this expression into the other equation.
3. Solve the resulting equation with one variable.
4. Substitute the value back to find the other variable.
5. Check the solution in both original equations.

### Example 1: üåü

Solve these equations using the substitution method:
2x + 3y = 8
5x - 2y = 1

**Step 1:** Express x in terms of y from the first equation:
2x + 3y = 8
2x = 8 - 3y
x = (8 - 3y)/2 = 4 - 3y/2

**Step 2:** Substitute this into the second equation:
5(4 - 3y/2) - 2y = 1
20 - 15y/2 - 2y = 1
20 - 7.5y - 2y = 1
20 - 9.5y = 1
-9.5y = 1 - 20 = -19
y = 2

**Step 3:** Substitute back to find x:
x = 4 - 3(2)/2 = 4 - 3 = 1

**Step 4:** Check the solution (1, 2) in both equations:
2(1) + 3(2) = 2 + 6 = 8 ‚úì
5(1) - 2(2) = 5 - 4 = 1 ‚úì

The solution is x = 1, y = 2.

### Advantages of Substitution Method: ‚úÖ
- Works well when one variable has coefficient 1
- Generally straightforward conceptually
- Sometimes involves simpler arithmetic than other methods

### Disadvantages of Substitution Method: ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Can lead to fractional expressions that complicate arithmetic
- May be inefficient when both equations have complex coefficients

## Method 2: Elimination Method ‚ûñ

The elimination method involves adding or subtracting the equations to eliminate one variable, then solving for the remaining variable.

### Steps for Elimination Method:
1. Multiply one or both equations by appropriate numbers to make the coefficient of one variable the same in both equations (or with opposite signs).
2. Add or subtract the equations to eliminate one variable.
3. Solve for the remaining variable.
4. Substitute back into one of the original equations to find the other variable.
5. Check the solution in both original equations.

### Example 2: üåü

Solve these equations using the elimination method:
3x + 4y = 10
2x - 5y = 3

**Step 1:** To eliminate x, multiply the second equation by 3/2:
3x + 4y = 10
3x - 7.5y = 4.5

**Step 2:** Subtract the second equation from the first:
3x + 4y = 10
3x - 7.5y = 4.5
---------------
11.5y = 5.5
y = 5.5/11.5 = 0.5 = 1/2

**Step 3:** Substitute y = 1/2 into the first equation:
3x + 4(1/2) = 10
3x + 2 = 10
3x = 8
x = 8/3

**Step 4:** Check the solution (8/3, 1/2) in both equations:
3(8/3) + 4(1/2) = 8 + 2 = 10 ‚úì
2(8/3) - 5(1/2) = 16/3 - 5/2 = 16/3 - 15/6 = 32/6 - 15/6 = 17/6 = 3 ‚úì

The solution is x = 8/3, y = 1/2.

### Advantages of Elimination Method: ‚úÖ
- Often involves less algebraic manipulation than substitution
- Works well when coefficients are easily made equal or opposite
- Usually more efficient when looking for only one variable's value

### Disadvantages of Elimination Method: ‚ö†Ô∏è
- May require multiplication by large numbers to align coefficients
- Can involve more arithmetic operations than other methods

## Method 3: Cross-Multiplication Method üîÑ

The cross-multiplication method uses determinants to find the values of variables directly. It's particularly useful when we need the values of both variables.

### Formulas for Cross-Multiplication:
If a‚ÇÅx + b‚ÇÅy + c‚ÇÅ = 0 and a‚ÇÇx + b‚ÇÇy + c‚ÇÇ = 0, then:

x = (b‚ÇÅc‚ÇÇ - b‚ÇÇc‚ÇÅ)/(a‚ÇÅb‚ÇÇ - a‚ÇÇb‚ÇÅ)
y = (c‚ÇÅa‚ÇÇ - c‚ÇÇa‚ÇÅ)/(a‚ÇÅb‚ÇÇ - a‚ÇÇb‚ÇÅ)

These formulas can be visualized using determinants:

x = |c‚ÇÅ b‚ÇÅ|/|a‚ÇÅ b‚ÇÅ| and y = |a‚ÇÅ c‚ÇÅ|/|a‚ÇÅ b‚ÇÅ|
    |c‚ÇÇ b‚ÇÇ|  |a‚ÇÇ b‚ÇÇ|      |a‚ÇÇ c‚ÇÇ|  |a‚ÇÇ b‚ÇÇ|

### Example 3: üåü

Solve these equations using the cross-multiplication method:
4x - 5y - 3 = 0
3x + 2y - 11 = 0

First, identify the coefficients:
a‚ÇÅ = 4, b‚ÇÅ = -5, c‚ÇÅ = -3
a‚ÇÇ = 3, b‚ÇÇ = 2, c‚ÇÇ = -11

Calculate the denominator:
a‚ÇÅb‚ÇÇ - a‚ÇÇb‚ÇÅ = 4(2) - 3(-5) = 8 + 15 = 23

Calculate x:
x = (b‚ÇÅc‚ÇÇ - b‚ÇÇc‚ÇÅ)/(a‚ÇÅb‚ÇÇ - a‚ÇÇb‚ÇÅ)
  = ((-5)(-11) - 2(-3))/23
  = (55 + 6)/23
  = 61/23

Calculate y:
y = (c‚ÇÅa‚ÇÇ - c‚ÇÇa‚ÇÅ)/(a‚ÇÅb‚ÇÇ - a‚ÇÇb‚ÇÅ)
  = ((-3)(3) - (-11)(4))/23
  = (-9 + 44)/23
  = 35/23

**Check the solution (61/23, 35/23):**
4(61/23) - 5(35/23) - 3 = 244/23 - 175/23 - 69/23 = 0 ‚úì
3(61/23) + 2(35/23) - 11 = 183/23 + 70/23 - 253/23 = 0 ‚úì

The solution is x = 61/23, y = 35/23.

### Advantages of Cross-Multiplication Method: ‚úÖ
- Provides a direct formula for both variables
- No need for back-substitution
- Works well for complex coefficients
- Less prone to arithmetic errors in some cases

### Disadvantages of Cross-Multiplication Method: ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Requires memorizing formulas
- May be cumbersome for simple equations where other methods are quicker
- Can involve more complex calculations

## Types of Solutions for a Pair of Linear Equations üìä

A pair of linear equations can have three types of solutions:

1. **Unique Solution**: When the lines intersect at exactly one point. This happens when a‚ÇÅ/a‚ÇÇ ‚â† b‚ÇÅ/b‚ÇÇ.

2. **No Solution**: When the lines are parallel but not coincident. This happens when a‚ÇÅ/a‚ÇÇ = b‚ÇÅ/b‚ÇÇ ‚â† c‚ÇÅ/c‚ÇÇ.

3. **Infinitely Many Solutions**: When the lines are coincident (same line). This happens when a‚ÇÅ/a‚ÇÇ = b‚ÇÅ/b‚ÇÇ = c‚ÇÅ/c‚ÇÇ.

### Example of No Solution: üåü

Solve: 2x + 3y = 5 and 4x + 6y = 15

Looking at the coefficients: a‚ÇÅ/a‚ÇÇ = 2/4 = 1/2 and b‚ÇÅ/b‚ÇÇ = 3/6 = 1/2, but c‚ÇÅ/c‚ÇÇ = 5/15 = 1/3

Since a‚ÇÅ/a‚ÇÇ = b‚ÇÅ/b‚ÇÇ ‚â† c‚ÇÅ/c‚ÇÇ, these lines are parallel and have no solution.

### Example of Infinitely Many Solutions: üåü

Solve: 3x - 6y + 9 = 0 and 1x - 2y + 3 = 0

Looking at the coefficients: a‚ÇÅ/a‚ÇÇ = 3/1 = 3, b‚ÇÅ/b‚ÇÇ = -6/-2 = 3, and c‚ÇÅ/c‚ÇÇ = 9/3 = 3

Since a‚ÇÅ/a‚ÇÇ = b‚ÇÅ/b‚ÇÇ = c‚ÇÅ/c‚ÇÇ, these equations represent the same line and have infinitely many solutions.

## Choosing the Right Method ‚öñÔ∏è

Each method has its strengths, and the choice depends on the specific equations:

- **Substitution** is best when one equation has a variable with coefficient 1, making it easy to isolate
- **Elimination** is preferred when coefficients can be easily matched to eliminate a variable
- **Cross-multiplication** is useful for finding both values directly or when other methods are cumbersome

## Real-Life Applications üåç

Pairs of linear equations can model many real-world situations:

### Example 4: Mixture Problems üß™

A chemist has two solutions of acid. The first solution is 50% acid and the second is 75% acid. How many liters of each solution should be mixed to get 10 liters of a 60% acid solution?

Let x = liters of 50% solution and y = liters of 75% solution.
From the total volume: x + y = 10
From the acid content: 0.5x + 0.75y = 0.6(10) = 6

Solving these equations:
x + y = 10
0.5x + 0.75y = 6

Using elimination:
0.5x + 0.5y = 5 (multiply first equation by 0.5)
0.5x + 0.75y = 6 (second equation as is)

Subtracting:
0.25y = 1
y = 4

Substituting back:
x + 4 = 10
x = 6

Therefore, we need 6 liters of 50% solution and 4 liters of 75% solution.

### Example 5: Cost Problems üí∞

A person bought 5 pens and 3 pencils for ‚Çπ80. Another person bought 2 pens and 4 pencils of the same kind for ‚Çπ58. Find the cost of each pen and pencil.

Let x = cost of one pen and y = cost of one pencil.
First purchase: 5x + 3y = 80
Second purchase: 2x + 4y = 58

Using elimination:
10x + 6y = 160 (multiply first equation by 2)
10x + 20y = 290 (multiply second equation by 5)

Subtracting:
-14y = -130
y = 130/14 = 65/7

Substituting back:
5x + 3(65/7) = 80
5x + 195/7 = 80
5x = 80 - 195/7 = 560/7 - 195/7 = 365/7
x = 73/7

Therefore, each pen costs ‚Çπ73/7 = ‚Çπ10.42 and each pencil costs ‚Çπ65/7 = ‚Çπ9.28 (approximately).
