# Simple Division Word Problems üßÆ

Division helps us solve many everyday problems! In this topic, we will learn how to solve simple division word problems. These problems involve sharing items equally among people or groups.

## Understanding Division Word Problems ü§î

Division word problems usually involve:
1. **Sharing equally** - dividing a total into a certain number of equal groups
2. **Grouping equally** - finding how many equal groups can be made

Key words that suggest division in word problems include:
- Share equally
- Distribute evenly
- Each gets the same
- Split equally
- How many in each group

## Steps to Solve Division Word Problems üìù

Let's learn a simple method to solve division word problems:

1. **Read carefully** - Understand what the problem is asking
2. **Identify the key information**:
   - What is the total amount (dividend)?
   - What are we dividing by (divisor)?
3. **Set up the division** - Write the division equation
4. **Solve** - Find the answer (quotient)
5. **Check** - Make sure your answer makes sense

## Types of Division Word Problems üìä

### Type 1: Sharing Equally Among a Given Number of Groups

In these problems, we know the total number of items and the number of groups. We need to find how many items each group will get.

**Example 1**: Ravi has 15 chocolates. He wants to share them equally with his 2 friends and himself. How many chocolates will each person get?

Let's solve this step-by-step:
1. **Read**: We need to find how many chocolates each person will get.
2. **Identify**:
   - Total amount: 15 chocolates
   - Number of people: 3 (Ravi and his 2 friends)
3. **Set up**: 15 √∑ 3 = ?
4. **Solve**: 15 √∑ 3 = 5
5. **Check**: 5 √ó 3 = 15 ‚úì

So, each person will get 5 chocolates.

**Example 2**: Mom baked 24 cookies. She wants to share them equally among her 4 children. How many cookies will each child get?

1. **Read**: We need to find how many cookies each child will get.
2. **Identify**:
   - Total amount: 24 cookies
   - Number of children: 4
3. **Set up**: 24 √∑ 4 = ?
4. **Solve**: 24 √∑ 4 = 6
5. **Check**: 6 √ó 4 = 24 ‚úì

So, each child will get 6 cookies.

### Type 2: Finding How Many Equal Groups Can Be Made

In these problems, we know the total number of items and how many items should be in each group. We need to find how many complete groups can be made.

**Example 3**: A teacher has 30 stickers. She wants to give 5 stickers to each student. How many students can receive stickers?

Let's solve this step-by-step:
1. **Read**: We need to find how many students will receive stickers.
2. **Identify**:
   - Total amount: 30 stickers
   - Number of stickers per student: 5
3. **Set up**: 30 √∑ 5 = ?
4. **Solve**: 30 √∑ 5 = 6
5. **Check**: 6 √ó 5 = 30 ‚úì

So, 6 students can receive stickers.

**Example 4**: Sarah has 28 beads. She wants to make bracelets using 7 beads for each bracelet. How many complete bracelets can she make?

1. **Read**: We need to find how many bracelets Sarah can make.
2. **Identify**:
   - Total amount: 28 beads
   - Number of beads per bracelet: 7
3. **Set up**: 28 √∑ 7 = ?
4. **Solve**: 28 √∑ 7 = 4
5. **Check**: 4 √ó 7 = 28 ‚úì

So, Sarah can make 4 complete bracelets.

## Clue Words in Division Word Problems üîç

Here are some clue words and phrases that can help you identify division word problems:

- "How many in each...?"
- "Shared equally among..."
- "Distributed evenly to..."
- "Each person gets the same amount..."
- "Divided equally between..."
- "How many groups can be made...?"

When you see these phrases, think about division!

## Drawing Pictures to Solve Division Problems üñºÔ∏è

Sometimes, drawing pictures can help us understand and solve division word problems.

**Example 5**: A teacher has 12 pencils. She gives 3 pencils to each student. How many students get pencils?

We can draw 12 pencils and circle groups of 3:
\`\`\`
‚úèÔ∏è ‚úèÔ∏è ‚úèÔ∏è | ‚úèÔ∏è ‚úèÔ∏è ‚úèÔ∏è | ‚úèÔ∏è ‚úèÔ∏è ‚úèÔ∏è | ‚úèÔ∏è ‚úèÔ∏è ‚úèÔ∏è
  Group 1  |  Group 2  |  Group 3  |  Group 4
\`\`\`

We can make 4 groups with 3 pencils each.
So, 12 √∑ 3 = 4 students will get pencils.

3. **Planning a trip**: If a car travels 300 kilometers on 50 liters of fuel, it travels 300 √∑ 50 = 6 kilometers per liter.

4. **Making groups**: If 35 students need to be divided into teams of 7, we can make 35 √∑ 7 = 5 teams.

## Tips for Solving Division Word Problems üí°

1. **Read the problem carefully** - Understand what is being asked.

2. **Highlight key information** - Mark the total amount and what you're dividing by.

3. **Draw a picture** - Visualize the problem if needed.

4. **Check if your answer makes sense** - Multiply your answer by the divisor to see if you get the original total.

5. **Practice regularly** - The more problems you solve, the better you'll get!

## Common Mistakes to Avoid ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **Not reading carefully** - Make sure you understand if the problem is asking "how many in each group" or "how many groups."

2. **Using the wrong operation** - Be sure the problem calls for division, not multiplication, addition, or subtraction.

3. **Forgetting to check your answer** - Always verify that your answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
