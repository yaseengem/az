        question: "A toy costs ‚Çπ85. If its price is reduced by 20%, what is the new price of the toy?",
        options: ["‚Çπ65", "‚Çπ68", "‚Çπ70", "‚Çπ72"],
        correctAnswer: "‚Çπ68",
        explanation: "20% of ‚Çπ85 = 0.20 √ó ‚Çπ85 = ‚Çπ17. New price = ‚Çπ85 - ‚Çπ17 = ‚Çπ68. To find the reduced price, subtract the discount amount from the original price. üß∏",

        question: "Rahul buys 3 kg of apples for ‚Çπ180 and 2 kg of oranges for ‚Çπ100. What is the difference in the cost of 1 kg of apples and 1 kg of oranges?",

        correctAnswer: "‚Çπ10",
        explanation: "Cost of 1 kg apples = ‚Çπ180 √∑ 3 = ‚Çπ60. Cost of 1 kg oranges = ‚Çπ100 √∑ 2 = ‚Çπ50. Difference = ‚Çπ60 - ‚Çπ50 = ‚Çπ10. Compare unit prices to find the difference in cost per kilogram. üçé",
