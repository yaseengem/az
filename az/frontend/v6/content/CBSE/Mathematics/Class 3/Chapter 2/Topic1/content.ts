# Number Names and Numerals up to 999 🔢

Have you ever counted stars in the sky or grains of sand at the beach? There are so many! To count large numbers, we need to understand how to read, write, and work with them. In this topic, we'll learn about numbers up to 999 and how to name them.

## Understanding Numbers Up to 999 📊

Numbers help us count and measure things. When we count beyond 100, we move into three-digit numbers. These numbers have digits in three places: hundreds, tens, and ones.

### Place Value 🏆

Each digit in a number has a special position called its **place value**. The place value tells us how much that digit is worth based on where it is in the number.

In a 3-digit number, we have:
- **Hundreds place**: The leftmost digit
- **Tens place**: The middle digit
- **Ones place** (or Units place): The rightmost digit

For example, in the number **352**:
- 3 is in the hundreds place (worth 300)
- 5 is in the tens place (worth 50)
- 2 is in the ones place (worth 2)

So, 352 = 300 + 50 + 2

### Reading and Writing Numbers 📝

When we read and write numbers, we start from the left with the largest place value. Here's how we read some three-digit numbers:

- 123: One hundred twenty-three
- 205: Two hundred five
- 470: Four hundred seventy
- 999: Nine hundred ninety-nine

Notice that we don't use the word "and" between the hundreds and the rest of the number in Indian English.

## Number Names for Numbers up to 999 📚

Let's look at how to write number names for different types of three-digit numbers:

### When There Are No Zeros

- 234: Two hundred thirty-four
- 567: Five hundred sixty-seven
- 819: Eight hundred nineteen

### When There's a Zero in the Tens Place

- 304: Three hundred four (not "Three hundred and four")
- 708: Seven hundred eight
- 509: Five hundred nine

### When There's a Zero in the Ones Place

- 250: Two hundred fifty
- 670: Six hundred seventy
- 990: Nine hundred ninety

### When There Are Zeros in Both Tens and Ones Places

- 300: Three hundred
- 700: Seven hundred
- 900: Nine hundred

## Expanded Form of Numbers 🔍

Another way to write a number is in its **expanded form**. This shows the value of each digit according to its place value.

For example:
- 425 = 400 + 20 + 5
- 306 = 300 + 0 + 6 = 300 + 6
- 750 = 700 + 50 + 0 = 700 + 50

## Examples with Place Value 📊

Let's look at more examples to understand place value better:

### Example 1: 358
- 3 is in the hundreds place: 3 × 100 = 300
- 5 is in the tens place: 5 × 10 = 50
- 8 is in the ones place: 8 × 1 = 8
- So, 358 = 300 + 50 + 8

### Example 2: 604
- 6 is in the hundreds place: 6 × 100 = 600
- 0 is in the tens place: 0 × 10 = 0
- 4 is in the ones place: 4 × 1 = 4
- So, 604 = 600 + 0 + 4 = 600 + 4

### Example 3: 970
- 9 is in the hundreds place: 9 × 100 = 900
- 7 is in the tens place: 7 × 10 = 70
- 0 is in the ones place: 0 × 1 = 0
- So, 970 = 900 + 70 + 0 = 900 + 70

## Making Numbers from Place Values 🧩

We can also create numbers when we know the place values:

1. If we have 5 hundreds, 2 tens, and 8 ones:
   - 5 hundreds = 500
   - 2 tens = 20
   - 8 ones = 8
   - The number is 528

2. If we have 9 hundreds, 0 tens, and 3 ones:
   - 9 hundreds = 900
   - 0 tens = 0
   - 3 ones = 3
   - The number is 903

3. If we have 7 hundreds, 4 tens, and 0 ones:
   - 7 hundreds = 700
   - 4 tens = 40
   - 0 ones = 0
   - The number is 740

## Writing Numbers in Different Ways 🖊️

We can write numbers in different ways:

### Standard Form
This is how we normally write numbers: 347, 506, 890

### Word Form (Number Names)
This is how we say the numbers in words:
- 347: Three hundred forty-seven
- 506: Five hundred six
- 890: Eight hundred ninety

### Expanded Form
This shows the value of each digit:
- 347 = 300 + 40 + 7
- 506 = 500 + 0 + 6 = 500 + 6
- 890 = 800 + 90 + 0 = 800 + 90

## Comparing Numbers 📏

We can compare numbers to see which is larger or smaller.

### Rules for Comparing:
1. A number with more digits is larger than a number with fewer digits.
   - Example: 123 is larger than 99

2. For numbers with the same number of digits, compare the leftmost (highest place value) digits first.
   - Example: 528 is larger than 431 because 5 > 4

3. If the leftmost digits are the same, compare the next digit to the right.
   - Example: 352 is larger than 347 because 5 > 4

4. Continue until you find digits that are different.
   - Example: 425 is smaller than 429 because 5 < 9

### Example:
Let's compare 387 and 392:
- Both numbers have 3 digits.
- The hundreds digits are the same (3).
- The tens digits are different (8 and 9).
- Since 8 < 9, we know that 387 < 392.

## Real-Life Applications 🏫

Numbers up to 999 are used in many real-life situations:

1. **Shopping**: Prices of many items are between 100 and 999 rupees.
   - Example: A toy costs ₹325.

2. **Pages in Books**: Many books have several hundred pages.
   - Example: A storybook might have 278 pages.

3. **School Supplies**: Counting items in school.
   - Example: A school might have 512 students.

4. **Time**: Minutes in hours.
   - Example: There are 480 minutes in 8 hours.

5. **Distance**: Kilometers between cities.
   - Example: The distance between two towns might be 156 kilometers.

## Sample Questions to Try ✏️

Here are some questions to test your understanding:

1. **Question**: What is the place value of 7 in 275?
   **Answer**: 70 (tens place)

2. **Question**: Write 493 in expanded form.
   **Answer**: 400 + 90 + 3

3. **Question**: What is the number name for 650?
   **Answer**: Six hundred fifty

4. **Question**: What number has 8 hundreds, 3 tens, and 6 ones?
   **Answer**: 836

5. **Question**: Which is greater: 782 or 728?
   **Answer**: 782 (because 8 > 2 in the tens place)

## Fun Activities to Try at Home 🏠

1. **Number Cards**: Write digits 0-9 on separate cards and arrange them to form different three-digit numbers. Say the number names aloud.

2. **Expanding Numbers**: Pick any three-digit number and write it in its expanded form.

3. **Number Hunt**: Look for three-digit numbers around your home (on books, products, clocks) and write their number names.

4. **Place Value Game**: Roll three dice to create a three-digit number, then say its expanded form.

5. **Number Comparison**: Make two three-digit numbers and compare them using > (greater than) or < (less than) symbols.

## Summary 📝

In this topic, we learned about:

- Numbers up to 999 have three place values: hundreds, tens, and ones.
