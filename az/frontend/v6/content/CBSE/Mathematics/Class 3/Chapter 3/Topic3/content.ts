# Word Problems Involving Addition and Subtraction 🧩

Word problems help us connect mathematics to real life! In this topic, we'll learn how to solve word problems using addition and subtraction with 3-digit numbers. Let's explore how to read a problem, understand what it's asking, and decide whether to add or subtract to find the answer. 🌟

## Understanding Word Problems 📚

Word problems tell a story that contains mathematical information. To solve them:

1. **Read carefully** 👀 - Understand what the problem is about
2. **Identify key information** 🔍 - Find the numbers and what they represent
3. **Determine what to find** ❓ - Understand what question is being asked
4. **Choose the operation** ➕ or ➖ - Decide whether to add or subtract
5. **Solve the problem** ✅ - Perform the calculation
6. **Check your answer** 🔄 - Make sure your answer makes sense

## Clue Words for Addition ➕

Certain words in a problem often give us clues about which operation to use. Here are words that usually suggest addition:

- "Total"
- "Sum"
- "In all"
- "Altogether"
- "Combined"
- "Added to"
- "More"
- "Increased by"
- "Join"

## Example Addition Problems 🎯

**Example 1**: Ravi collected 236 stamps and his sister collected 145 stamps. How many stamps did they collect altogether?

Step 1: We need to find the total stamps collected by both Ravi and his sister.
Step 2: The key information is that Ravi has 236 stamps, and his sister has 145 stamps.
Step 3: We need to find the total number of stamps.
Step 4: Since we need a total, we should add: 236 + 145.
Step 5: 236 + 145 = 381 stamps.
Step 6: Check: Does our answer make sense? Yes, the total should be more than either person's individual collection.

**Example 2**: A school library has 325 storybooks. They received 248 more books. How many books does the library have now?

Step 1: We need to find how many books the library has after receiving more books.
Step 2: The library had 325 books initially and received 248 more books.
Step 3: We need to find the total number of books.
Step 4: Since books were added to the library's collection, we should add: 325 + 248.
Step 5: 325 + 248 = 573 books.
Step 6: Check: Our answer (573) is greater than the initial number of books (325), which makes sense since more books were added.

## Clue Words for Subtraction ➖

Here are words that usually suggest subtraction:

- "Difference"
- "How many more/less"
- "Remain"
- "Left"
- "Take away"
- "Decreased by"
- "Fewer"
- "Reduced by"
- "Spent"
- "Sold"

## Example Subtraction Problems 🎯

**Example 3**: A fruit shop had 475 apples. The shopkeeper sold 286 apples. How many apples are left?

Step 1: We need to find how many apples remain after some were sold.
Step 2: The shop had 475 apples initially, and 286 apples were sold.
Step 3: We need to find the number of apples remaining.
Step 4: Since apples were sold (taken away), we should subtract: 475 - 286.
Step 5: 475 - 286 = 189 apples.
Step 6: Check: Our answer (189) plus the apples sold (286) equals the initial number of apples (475), so our answer is correct.

**Example 4**: Rahul had 528 rupees. He spent 375 rupees on a toy car. How much money does Rahul have left?

Step 1: We need to find how much money Rahul has after spending some.
Step 2: Rahul had 528 rupees initially and spent 375 rupees.
Step 3: We need to find the remaining money.
Step 4: Since money was spent, we should subtract: 528 - 375.
Step 5: 528 - 375 = 153 rupees.
Step 6: Check: 153 + 375 = 528, so our answer is correct.

## Problems with Both Addition and Subtraction 🔄

Some problems require both addition and subtraction. Let's look at an example:

**Example 5**: A school ordered 325 notebooks and 248 textbooks. They distributed 356 books to students. How many books are left?

Step 1: We need to find the books remaining after distribution.
Step 2: The school ordered 325 notebooks and 248 textbooks, and distributed 356 books.
Step 3: We first need to find the total books ordered, then subtract the books distributed.
Step 4: Total books ordered = 325 + 248 = 573 books.
       Books remaining = 573 - 356 = 217 books.
Step 5: There are 217 books left.
Step 6: Check: 217 + 356 = 573, which matches the total ordered, so our answer is correct.

## Comparison Problems 📊

Sometimes, we need to find how much more or less one quantity is than another.

**Example 6**: Sita scored 425 marks in her exam. Gita scored 368 marks. How many more marks did Sita score than Gita?

Step 1: We need to find the difference between Sita's and Gita's marks.
Step 2: Sita scored 425 marks, and Gita scored 368 marks.
Step 3: We need to find how many more marks Sita scored.
Step 4: Since we're comparing and finding "how many more," we subtract: 425 - 368.
Step 5: 425 - 368 = 57 marks.
Step 6: Check: 368 + 57 = 425, so our answer is correct.

## Multi-Step Problems 🧠

Some problems have multiple steps. Let's try one:

**Example 7**: Raju had 350 marbles. He gave 75 marbles to his friend and then bought 125 more marbles. How many marbles does Raju have now?

Step 1: We need to find how many marbles Raju has after giving some away and buying more.
Step 2: Raju had 350 marbles initially, gave away 75, and bought 125 more.
Step 3: We need to find the final number of marbles.
Step 4: First, we subtract the marbles given away: 350 - 75 = 275 marbles.
       Then, we add the new marbles: 275 + 125 = 400 marbles.
Step 5: Raju now has 400 marbles.
Step 6: Check: Starting with 350, giving away 75 leaves 275, and adding 125 makes 400, so our answer is correct.

## Working Backwards 🔄

Sometimes, we know the result and one of the values, and we need to find the other value.

**Example 8**: Meera had some money. She spent 125 rupees on a book, and now has 275 rupees left. How much money did Meera have initially?

Step 1: We need to find Meera's initial amount of money.
Step 2: Meera spent 125 rupees and has 275 rupees left.
Step 3: We need to find the initial amount.
Step 4: If we call the initial amount x, then x - 125 = 275. To find x, we add: 275 + 125.
Step 5: 275 + 125 = 400 rupees.
Step 6: Check: 400 - 125 = 275, which matches the remaining amount, so our answer is correct.

## Tips for Solving Word Problems 💡

1. **Draw pictures or diagrams** 🖼️ - Visualizing the problem can help you understand it better.

2. **Label the unknowns** ❓ - If you're not sure what to find, use a variable like x to represent it.

3. **Check your answer in the context of the problem** ✅ - Make sure your answer makes sense in real life.

4. **Watch out for irrelevant information** 🚫 - Some problems might contain extra information that you don't need.

5. **Read the problem at least twice** 🔄 - Make sure you understand what the problem is asking.

## More Practice Problems 🏋️‍♀️

Let's try a few more problems:

**Problem 1**: A fruit seller had 625 apples. He sold 238 apples on Monday and 167 apples on Tuesday. How many apples does he have left?

Solution:
- Total apples sold = 238 + 167 = 405 apples
- Remaining apples = 625 - 405 = 220 apples

**Problem 2**: A school has 248 boys and 273 girls. How many students are there in the school?

Solution:
- Total students = 248 + 273 = 521 students

**Problem 3**: A water tank contained 750 liters of water. If 325 liters were used, how much water remains in the tank?

Solution:
- Remaining water = 750 - 325 = 425 liters

**Problem 4**: Rita had 325 stickers. She gave 45 stickers to her friend and then received 85 new stickers from her mother. How many stickers does Rita have now?

Solution:
- Stickers after giving to friend = 325 - 45 = 280 stickers
- Final number of stickers = 280 + 85 = 365 stickers
