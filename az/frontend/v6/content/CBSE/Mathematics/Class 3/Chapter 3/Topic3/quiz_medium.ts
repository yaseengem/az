        question: "Rani had some marbles. She won 25 more marbles in a game. Now she has 73 marbles. How many marbles did Rani have in the beginning?",
        options: ["48 marbles", "98 marbles", "25 marbles", "73 marbles"],
        correctAnswer: "48 marbles",
        explanation: "If she started with x marbles, then x + 25 = 73. Solving for x: x = 73 - 25 = 48 marbles. This requires working backwards using subtraction. üîÆ",
        wrongAnswerExplanations: {
            "98 marbles": "You added instead of subtracting: 73 + 25 = 98. Since she gained 25 marbles, we need to subtract to find the starting amount.",
            "25 marbles": "This is the number of marbles she won, not what she started with.",
            "73 marbles": "This is her final number of marbles, not what she started with."

        question: "A car traveled 157 km on Monday, 203 km on Tuesday, and 184 km on Wednesday. How much farther did the car travel on Tuesday than on Monday?",
        options: ["46 km", "544 km", "19 km", "360 km"],
        correctAnswer: "46 km",
        explanation: "To find how much farther the car traveled on Tuesday than Monday, subtract: 203 - 157 = 46 km. This uses subtraction to compare two quantities. üöó",

            "544 km": "This is the total distance traveled on all three days (157 + 203 + 184 = 544), not the difference between Tuesday and Monday.",
            "19 km": "This is the difference between Tuesday and Wednesday (203 - 184 = 19), not between Tuesday and Monday.",
