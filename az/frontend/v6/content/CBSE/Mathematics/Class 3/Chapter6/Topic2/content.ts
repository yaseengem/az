# Simple Transactions and Calculations üí∞üßæ

Money is an important part of our daily life. We use it to buy things, pay for services, and save for the future. In this topic, you will learn how to use money, make simple transactions, and do calculations with rupees (‚Çπ) and paise (p).

## What is Money? üíµ
Money is what we use to buy things. In India, we use rupees (‚Çπ) and paise (p). 1 rupee = 100 paise. Coins and notes come in different values, like ‚Çπ1, ‚Çπ2, ‚Çπ5, ‚Çπ10, ‚Çπ20, ‚Çπ50, ‚Çπ100, and so on.

## Understanding Rupees and Paise
- 1 rupee (‚Çπ1) = 100 paise (100p)
- 50 paise = half a rupee (¬Ω‚Çπ)
- 25 paise = quarter of a rupee (¬º‚Çπ)

### Example:
- 150 paise = 1 rupee 50 paise = ‚Çπ1.50
- 250 paise = 2 rupees 50 paise = ‚Çπ2.50

## Making Transactions üõí
A transaction is when you buy or sell something. You give money to get things or get money when you sell things.

### Example:
- You buy a pencil for ‚Çπ5. You give ‚Çπ5 to the shopkeeper and get the pencil.
- If you give ‚Çπ10 for a ‚Çπ7 eraser, you get ‚Çπ3 back as change.

## Calculating Total Cost
When you buy more than one thing, add their prices to find the total cost.

### Example:
- A pen costs ‚Çπ7 and a notebook costs ‚Çπ13. Total = ‚Çπ7 + ‚Çπ13 = ‚Çπ20

## Calculating Change
If you pay more than the cost, subtract the cost from the money you gave to find the change.

### Example:
- You pay ‚Çπ50 for a toy costing ‚Çπ32. Change = ‚Çπ50 - ‚Çπ32 = ‚Çπ18

## Converting Paise to Rupees
To convert paise to rupees, divide by 100.
- 250 paise = 250 √∑ 100 = ‚Çπ2.50

## Word Problems and Real-Life Examples
1. Riya buys a chocolate for ‚Çπ12 and a juice for ‚Çπ18. How much does she spend? (‚Çπ12 + ‚Çπ18 = ‚Çπ30)
2. You have ‚Çπ100. You buy a ball for ‚Çπ45. How much is left? (‚Çπ100 - ‚Çπ45 = ‚Çπ55)
3. Convert 350 paise to rupees. (350 √∑ 100 = ‚Çπ3.50)

## Tips for Transactions üìù
- Always check the total cost before paying.
- Count your change carefully.
- Remember 1 rupee = 100 paise.

## Practice Questions üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1. If you buy a pen for ‚Çπ8 and a ruler for ‚Çπ12, what is the total cost?
2. You pay ‚Çπ20 for a toy costing ‚Çπ15. How much change do you get?
3. Convert 500 paise to rupees.

## Summary ‚ú®
- Money is used for buying and selling.
- Add prices to find total cost.
- Subtract to find change.
- 1 rupee = 100 paise.
- Practice helps you become smart with money! üòä
