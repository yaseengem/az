# Simple Transactions and Word Problems üí∞

Have you ever gone shopping with your parents? üõí Or perhaps helped at home counting money? Understanding how to handle money transactions is an important life skill that we all need. In this topic, we'll learn how to solve simple money-related problems that you might encounter in daily life.

## What Are Simple Transactions? ü™ô

A transaction happens when we exchange money for goods or services. Some examples include:
- Buying groceries at a store
- Purchasing a ticket for a movie
- Paying for a bus ride
- Buying toys or books

In each of these cases, we need to understand:
- How much things cost
- How to calculate the total cost when buying multiple items
- How to determine the change we should receive
- How to find the best deals

## Basic Money Calculations üìä

### Addition in Money Problems

When we buy multiple items, we need to add their costs to find the total amount.

**Example 1:** Ram buys a pencil for ‚Çπ5 and an eraser for ‚Çπ3. How much does he spend in total?
- Total cost = ‚Çπ5 + ‚Çπ3 = ‚Çπ8

**Example 2:** Sita buys a notebook for ‚Çπ25, a pen for ‚Çπ10, and a ruler for ‚Çπ15. How much does she spend in total?
- Total cost = ‚Çπ25 + ‚Çπ10 + ‚Çπ15 = ‚Çπ50

### Subtraction in Money Problems

Subtraction helps us find:
1. How much money is left after spending
2. How much change we should receive

**Example 3:** Ritu has ‚Çπ50. She spends ‚Çπ35 on a book. How much money does she have left?
- Money left = ‚Çπ50 - ‚Çπ35 = ‚Çπ15

**Example 4:** Arun gives a shopkeeper ‚Çπ100 for items costing ‚Çπ64. How much change should he get?
- Change = ‚Çπ100 - ‚Çπ64 = ‚Çπ36

### Multiplication in Money Problems

When buying multiple items of the same price, we use multiplication.

**Example 5:** One chocolate costs ‚Çπ12. How much will 5 chocolates cost?
- Cost of 5 chocolates = 5 √ó ‚Çπ12 = ‚Çπ60

**Example 6:** Mohan buys 4 notebooks, each costing ‚Çπ15. How much does he pay in total?
- Total cost = 4 √ó ‚Çπ15 = ‚Çπ60

### Division in Money Problems

Division helps us find:
1. The cost of one item when we know the total cost of multiple items
2. How many items we can buy with a certain amount of money

**Example 7:** Three identical books cost ‚Çπ90 in total. What is the cost of one book?
- Cost of one book = ‚Çπ90 √∑ 3 = ‚Çπ30

**Example 8:** Neha has ‚Çπ100. If one toy costs ‚Çπ25, how many toys can she buy?
- Number of toys = ‚Çπ100 √∑ ‚Çπ25 = 4 toys

## Different Types of Money Word Problems üìù

### 1. Finding the Total Cost

These problems ask you to calculate how much money is needed to buy multiple items.

**Problem:** Rani buys 3 apples for ‚Çπ15 each and 2 bananas for ‚Çπ8 each. How much does she spend in total?

**Solution:**
- Cost of apples = 3 √ó ‚Çπ15 = ‚Çπ45
- Cost of bananas = 2 √ó ‚Çπ8 = ‚Çπ16
- Total cost = ‚Çπ45 + ‚Çπ16 = ‚Çπ61

### 2. Finding the Change

These problems ask you to calculate how much money should be returned after a purchase.

**Problem:** Rohit buys a toy for ‚Çπ35 and gives the shopkeeper a ‚Çπ50 note. How much change should he get?

**Solution:**
- Change = ‚Çπ50 - ‚Çπ35 = ‚Çπ15

### 3. Finding How Much Money is Left

These problems ask you to calculate the remaining money after spending.

**Problem:** Meera had ‚Çπ75. She spent ‚Çπ25 on a book and ‚Çπ30 on stationery. How much money does she have left?

**Solution:**
- Total spent = ‚Çπ25 + ‚Çπ30 = ‚Çπ55
- Money left = ‚Çπ75 - ‚Çπ55 = ‚Çπ20

### 4. Finding the Unit Price

These problems ask you to calculate the cost of one item when you know the total cost.

**Problem:** Six notebooks cost ‚Çπ90 in total. What is the cost of one notebook?

**Solution:**
- Cost of one notebook = ‚Çπ90 √∑ 6 = ‚Çπ15

### 5. Finding the Number of Items

These problems ask you to determine how many items can be purchased with a given amount of money.

**Problem:** Arjun has ‚Çπ50. If one chocolate costs ‚Çπ8, how many chocolates can he buy?

**Solution:**
- Number of chocolates = ‚Çπ50 √∑ ‚Çπ8 = 6.25
- Since we can't buy a partial chocolate, Arjun can buy 6 chocolates.

### 6. Profit and Loss

These problems involve calculating profit or loss in simple buying and selling situations.

**Problem:** A shopkeeper buys 10 pencils for ‚Çπ40 and sells them for ‚Çπ6 each. What is his profit?

**Solution:**
- Cost price = ‚Çπ40
- Selling price = 10 √ó ‚Çπ6 = ‚Çπ60
- Profit = Selling price - Cost price = ‚Çπ60 - ‚Çπ40 = ‚Çπ20
