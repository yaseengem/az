# Addition and Subtraction of Money üí∞

Money is an important part of our daily lives. We use it to buy things, save for the future, and keep track of what we earn and spend. In this topic, we'll learn how to add and subtract money amounts in rupees (‚Çπ) and paise format.

## Understanding Money üíµ

In India, our currency is the Indian Rupee (‚Çπ). Let's understand some basic facts about money:

1. **Rupees and Paise**: 100 paise = 1 rupee (‚Çπ1)
2. **Coins**: We have coins of different values like 50 paise, ‚Çπ1, ‚Çπ2, ‚Çπ5, and ‚Çπ10
3. **Notes**: We have notes of values like ‚Çπ10, ‚Çπ20, ‚Çπ50, ‚Çπ100, ‚Çπ200, ‚Çπ500, and ‚Çπ2000

## Why We Need to Add and Subtract Money ü§î

We add and subtract money in many situations:
- When we buy multiple items and need to find the total cost
- When we pay for something and need to calculate the change
- When we count how much money we saved
- When we keep track of money we earn and spend

## Addition of Money üìà

Adding money is just like adding regular numbers. We're finding the total amount when we combine different amounts of money.

### Method for Adding Money:

1. Arrange the amounts in columns (rupees under rupees, paise under paise)
2. Add the paise column first
3. If the paise sum is 100 or more, convert to rupees and carry over
4. Add the rupees column including any carry over

### Examples of Money Addition:

**Example 1**: Find ‚Çπ15 + ‚Çπ12

\`\`\`
‚Çπ15
+‚Çπ12
-----
‚Çπ27
\`\`\`

**Example 2**: Find ‚Çπ25.50 + ‚Çπ10.75

\`\`\`
‚Çπ25.50
+‚Çπ10.75
--------
‚Çπ36.25
\`\`\`

Step 1: Add paise: 50p + 75p = 125p = ‚Çπ1 + 25p (Carry ‚Çπ1)  
Step 2: Add rupees (including carry): ‚Çπ25 + ‚Çπ10 + ‚Çπ1 = ‚Çπ36  
Step 3: Result: ‚Çπ36.25

### Real-life Example:
Ravi buys a notebook for ‚Çπ25 and a pencil for ‚Çπ5. How much does he spend in total?
Total cost = ‚Çπ25 + ‚Çπ5 = ‚Çπ30

## Subtraction of Money üìâ

Subtraction of money helps us find the difference between two amounts. We use it to calculate how much is left after spending, how much more we need, or the difference between prices.

### Method for Subtracting Money:

1. Arrange the amounts in columns (rupees under rupees, paise under paise)
2. Subtract the paise column first
3. If you can't subtract (smaller from larger), borrow ‚Çπ1 (100 paise) from the rupees column
4. Subtract the rupees column

### Examples of Money Subtraction:

**Example 1**: Find ‚Çπ25 - ‚Çπ12

\`\`\`
‚Çπ25
-‚Çπ12
-----
‚Çπ13
\`\`\`

**Example 2**: Find ‚Çπ50.25 - ‚Çπ25.75

\`\`\`
‚Çπ50.25
-‚Çπ25.75
--------
‚Çπ24.50
\`\`\`

Step 1: Subtract paise: 25p - 75p (can't do this, so borrow ‚Çπ1 from ‚Çπ50)  
        Now we have ‚Çπ49.125 - ‚Çπ25.75  
        125p - 75p = 50p  
Step 2: Subtract rupees: ‚Çπ49 - ‚Çπ25 = ‚Çπ24  
Step 3: Result: ‚Çπ24.50

### Real-life Example:
Meena has ‚Çπ50 and buys a book for ‚Çπ35. How much money does she have left?
Money left = ‚Çπ50 - ‚Çπ35 = ‚Çπ15

## Word Problems Involving Money üìù

Let's solve some real-life problems involving money:

### Problem 1: Finding the total cost
Riya buys a chocolate for ‚Çπ15, a packet of chips for ‚Çπ10, and a juice box for ‚Çπ20. How much does she spend in total?

**Solution**:
Total cost = ‚Çπ15 + ‚Çπ10 + ‚Çπ20 = ‚Çπ45

### Problem 2: Finding the change
Rahul buys a toy for ‚Çπ35. If he gives the shopkeeper a ‚Çπ50 note, how much change will he get?

**Solution**:
Change = ‚Çπ50 - ‚Çπ35 = ‚Çπ15

### Problem 3: Finding how much more is needed
Sita wants to buy a book that costs ‚Çπ40. She has ‚Çπ25 with her. How much more money does she need?

**Solution**:
Money needed = ‚Çπ40 - ‚Çπ25 = ‚Çπ15

### Problem 4: Multiple transactions
Raj had ‚Çπ100. He spent ‚Çπ25 on a book and ‚Çπ15 on a pen. Later, his father gave him ‚Çπ20. How much money does he have now?

**Solution**:
Step 1: Find the total spent: ‚Çπ25 + ‚Çπ15 = ‚Çπ40
Step 2: Find what's left after spending: ‚Çπ100 - ‚Çπ40 = ‚Çπ60
Step 3: Add what his father gave: ‚Çπ60 + ‚Çπ20 = ‚Çπ80
So, Raj has ‚Çπ80 now.

## Tips for Working with Money üí°

1. **Careful Alignment**: When adding or subtracting money, make sure rupees align with rupees and paise with paise
2. **Check Your Answer**: After solving, ask yourself if the answer makes sense
3. **Use Real Objects**: Practice with toy coins and notes to better understand

## Common Mistakes to Avoid ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. Forgetting to carry over when paise add up to 100 or more
2. Not borrowing correctly when subtracting paise
3. Confusing addition and subtraction in word problems
4. Not reading word problems carefully

## Sample Questions for Practice ‚úçÔ∏è

1. Add ‚Çπ15 + ‚Çπ23
2. Add ‚Çπ27.50 + ‚Çπ12.75
3. Subtract ‚Çπ15 from ‚Çπ32
4. Subtract ‚Çπ18.75 from ‚Çπ35.50
5. Amit has ‚Çπ50. He buys a book for ‚Çπ35. How much money does he have left?
6. Ravi buys a pen for ‚Çπ12 and a notebook for ‚Çπ25. How much does he spend in all?
