        question: "Ram is standing facing the rising sun. In which direction is his shadow pointing?",
        options: ["East", "West", "North", "South"],
        correctAnswer: "West",
        explanation: "The sun rises in the east. If Ram is facing east (toward the rising sun), his shadow will be cast in the opposite direction, which is west. Understanding how shadows work in relation to light sources helps with directional awareness. üåÖ",

        explanation: "Anita moves 2 steps up, 3 steps right, 1 step down, and 1 step left. The net movement is 1 step up (2 up - 1 down) and 2 steps right (3 right - 1 left). Calculating net movement in two dimensions helps solve puzzles. üß©",
