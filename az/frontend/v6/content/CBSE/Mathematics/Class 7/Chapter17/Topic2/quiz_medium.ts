        explanation: "Break 98 into (100 - 2), then multiply each part by 5. 100 Ã— 5 = 500, 2 Ã— 5 = 10, so 98 Ã— 5 = 490. This is faster than other methods. ðŸŽ¯",

        correctAnswer: "Divide by 8 and multiply by 7",
        explanation: "87.5% = 7/8 = 0.875, so divide by 8 and multiply by 7. For example, 87.5% of 40 = (40 Ã· 8) Ã— 7 = 5 Ã— 7 = 35. This is quicker than other methods. ðŸ’¡",

        explanation: "For two-digit numbers Ã— 11, add the digits and put sum between them. For 45 Ã— 11: 4 + 5 = 9, so answer is 495. If sum > 9, carry over. ðŸ§®",
