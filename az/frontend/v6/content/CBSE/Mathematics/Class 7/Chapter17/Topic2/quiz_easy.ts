        correctAnswer: "Multiply by 10 and divide by 2",
        explanation: "To multiply by 5, multiply by 10 (add a zero) and divide by 2. For example, 24 √ó 5 = 240 √∑ 2 = 120. This works because 5 = 10 √∑ 2. üßÆ",

        correctAnswer: "Divide by 10 and add half of that",
        explanation: "To find 15%, divide by 10 (10%) and add half of that (5%). For example, 15% of 80 = 8 + 4 = 12. This works because 15% = 10% + 5%. üí°",

        correctAnswer: "Write the same digit twice",
        explanation: "For single digits, multiplying by 11 gives a result where the digit is repeated. For example, 4 √ó 11 = 44, 7 √ó 11 = 77. This pattern works for all single digits. üî¢",

        correctAnswer: "Double the number twice",
        explanation: "To multiply by 4, double the number and then double again. For example, 23 √ó 4 = 23 √ó 2 = 46 √ó 2 = 92. This is faster than multiplying directly by 4. ‚úåÔ∏è",
