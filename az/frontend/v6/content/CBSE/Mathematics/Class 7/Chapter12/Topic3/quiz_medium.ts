        question: "The difference between the squares of two consecutive integers is 13. Which equation can be used to find the integers?",
        options: ["(x+1)¬≤ - x¬≤ = 13", "x¬≤ - (x+1)¬≤ = 13", "(x+1)¬≤ - (x-1)¬≤ = 13", "x¬≤ - (x-1)¬≤ = 13"],
        correctAnswer: "(x+1)¬≤ - x¬≤ = 13",
        explanation: "For consecutive integers x and x+1, the equation is (x+1)¬≤ - x¬≤ = 13. üìä",
        wrongAnswerExplanations: {
            "x¬≤ - (x+1)¬≤ = 13": "This gives a negative result since (x+1)¬≤ > x¬≤, contradicting the given difference of 13.",
            "(x+1)¬≤ - (x-1)¬≤ = 13": "This represents non-consecutive integers x-1 and x+1.",
            "x¬≤ - (x-1)¬≤ = 13": "This doesn't represent consecutive integers in the correct order."
