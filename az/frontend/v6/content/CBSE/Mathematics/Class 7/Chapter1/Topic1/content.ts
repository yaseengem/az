# Operations on Integers üî¢

Welcome to the fascinating world of integers! In this topic, we'll explore how to perform basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) with integers. Understanding these operations is crucial for solving real-life problems and building a strong foundation in mathematics. Let's dive in! üöÄ

## Understanding Integers üåü

Integers are whole numbers that can be positive, negative, or zero. They are represented on the number line as follows:
- Positive integers: 1, 2, 3, 4, ... (to the right of zero)
- Negative integers: -1, -2, -3, -4, ... (to the left of zero)
- Zero: 0 (the center point)

## Addition of Integers ‚ûï

Adding integers can be visualized using the number line:
1. **Adding two positive integers**: Move right on the number line
   - Example: 3 + 4 = 7
   - Real-life example: If you have ‚Çπ3 and earn ‚Çπ4 more, you now have ‚Çπ7

2. **Adding two negative integers**: Move left on the number line
   - Example: (-3) + (-4) = -7
   - Real-life example: If you owe ‚Çπ3 and borrow ‚Çπ4 more, you now owe ‚Çπ7

3. **Adding positive and negative integers**: Move towards the larger number
   - Example: 5 + (-3) = 2
   - Real-life example: If you have ‚Çπ5 and spend ‚Çπ3, you have ‚Çπ2 left

## Subtraction of Integers ‚ûñ

Subtraction can be thought of as adding the opposite:
1. **Subtracting a positive integer**: Move left on the number line
   - Example: 7 - 3 = 4
   - Real-life example: If you have ‚Çπ7 and spend ‚Çπ3, you have ‚Çπ4 left

2. **Subtracting a negative integer**: Move right on the number line
   - Example: 5 - (-3) = 8
   - Real-life example: If you have ‚Çπ5 and a debt of ‚Çπ3 is forgiven, you now have ‚Çπ8

3. **Subtracting from a negative integer**:
   - Example: (-4) - 2 = -6
   - Real-life example: If you owe ‚Çπ4 and spend ‚Çπ2 more, you now owe ‚Çπ6

## Multiplication of Integers ‚úñÔ∏è

The rules for multiplying integers are:
1. **Positive √ó Positive = Positive**
   - Example: 3 √ó 4 = 12
   - Real-life example: If you earn ‚Çπ3 per hour and work 4 hours, you earn ‚Çπ12

2. **Negative √ó Negative = Positive**
   - Example: (-3) √ó (-4) = 12
   - Real-life example: If you lose ‚Çπ3 per day and this happens for 4 days, you've lost ‚Çπ12

3. **Positive √ó Negative = Negative**
   - Example: 3 √ó (-4) = -12
   - Real-life example: If you spend ‚Çπ3 per day for 4 days, you've spent ‚Çπ12

4. **Negative √ó Positive = Negative**
   - Example: (-3) √ó 4 = -12
   - Real-life example: If you lose ‚Çπ3 per hour and this happens for 4 hours, you've lost ‚Çπ12

## Division of Integers ‚ûó

The rules for dividing integers are similar to multiplication:
1. **Positive √∑ Positive = Positive**
   - Example: 12 √∑ 3 = 4
   - Real-life example: If you have ‚Çπ12 and want to divide it equally among 3 friends, each gets ‚Çπ4

2. **Negative √∑ Negative = Positive**
   - Example: (-12) √∑ (-3) = 4
   - Real-life example: If you owe ‚Çπ12 and this debt is divided among 3 people, each person owes ‚Çπ4

3. **Positive √∑ Negative = Negative**
   - Example: 12 √∑ (-3) = -4
   - Real-life example: If you have ‚Çπ12 and want to give ‚Çπ3 to each person, you can give to 4 people

4. **Negative √∑ Positive = Negative**
   - Example: (-12) √∑ 3 = -4
   - Real-life example: If you owe ‚Çπ12 and want to pay it back in 3 installments, each installment is ‚Çπ4

## Properties of Integer Operations üîç

1. **Commutative Property**:
   - Addition: a + b = b + a
   - Multiplication: a √ó b = b √ó a
   - Example: 3 + 5 = 5 + 3 = 8

2. **Associative Property**:
   - Addition: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
   - Multiplication: (a √ó b) √ó c = a √ó (b √ó c)
   - Example: (2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4) = 9

3. **Distributive Property**:
   - a √ó (b + c) = a √ó b + a √ó c
   - Example: 3 √ó (4 + 5) = 3 √ó 4 + 3 √ó 5 = 27

4. **Identity Elements**:
   - Additive Identity: a + 0 = a
   - Multiplicative Identity: a √ó 1 = a
   - Example: 5 + 0 = 5, 5 √ó 1 = 5

## Real-Life Applications üåç

1. **Temperature Changes**:
   - If the temperature is 5¬∞C and drops by 7¬∞C, the new temperature is -2¬∞C
   - Example: 5 - 7 = -2

2. **Bank Transactions**:
   - If you have ‚Çπ1000 and withdraw ‚Çπ1500, your balance is -‚Çπ500
   - Example: 1000 - 1500 = -500

3. **Elevation Changes**:
   - If you're at 200m above sea level and descend 300m, you're at -100m
   - Example: 200 - 300 = -100

## Summary ‚ú®

In this topic, we've learned:
1. How to add, subtract, multiply, and divide integers
2. The rules for operations with positive and negative integers
3. Important properties of integer operations
