        question: "If 15 workers can build a wall in 10 days, how many workers would be needed to build the same wall in 6 days, if they work with 80% efficiency compared to the original workers?",
        options: ["25 workers", "31.25 workers", "30 workers", "22.5 workers"],
        correctAnswer: "31.25 workers",
        explanation: "Work = workers √ó days √ó efficiency. 15 √ó 10 √ó 1 = n √ó 6 √ó 0.8, giving n = (15 √ó 10) √∑ (6 √ó 0.8) = 150 √∑ 4.8 = 31.25 workers. Adjust for changing efficiency. üë∑",
