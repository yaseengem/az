# Financial Literacy Applications ๐ฐ

Financial literacy is an essential life skill that helps us make informed decisions about money management. In this topic, we'll explore how percentages, ratios, and simple interest can be applied to real-life financial situations. Understanding these applications will help you develop strong financial decision-making skills for your future! ๐ฏ

## Budgeting and Money Management ๐

Budgeting is a systematic approach to managing your income and expenses. It involves tracking how much money comes in and goes out over a specific period.

### Creating a Budget
A good budget typically allocates your income into different categories:
- **Needs** (50%): Essential expenses like food, housing, utilities
- **Wants** (30%): Non-essential expenses like entertainment, eating out
- **Savings and Debt Repayment** (20%): Money set aside for future needs or to pay off loans

**Example 1:** 
If Ravi earns โน20,000 per month, his budget might look like:
- Needs: 50% of โน20,000 = โน10,000
- Wants: 30% of โน20,000 = โน6,000
- Savings: 20% of โน20,000 = โน4,000

### Calculating Percentage of Income
To find what percentage of income you're spending on a particular expense:

Percentage = (Expense รท Total Income) ร 100%

**Example 2:**
If Priya pays โน7,500 rent from her monthly salary of โน25,000, what percentage of her income goes to rent?
Percentage = (7,500 รท 25,000) ร 100% = 30%

## Banking Applications ๐ฆ

### Simple Interest
One of the most common financial calculations is simple interest, which is the money earned or paid on a principal amount over time.

The formula for Simple Interest (SI) is:
SI = (P ร R ร T) รท 100

Where:
- P = Principal (the initial amount of money)
- R = Rate of interest per annum (yearly)
- T = Time period (in years)

**Example 3:**
If you deposit โน10,000 in a bank at 6% simple interest for 3 years, your interest earned would be:
SI = (10,000 ร 6 ร 3) รท 100 = โน1,800

The final amount in your account would be:
A = P + SI = โน10,000 + โน1,800 = โน11,800

### Comparing Investment Options
Different banks or financial institutions may offer different interest rates. To make an informed choice, calculate and compare the returns.

**Example 4:**
Bank A offers 5.5% simple interest and Bank B offers 5.75% simple interest. If you want to invest โน50,000 for 2 years, which bank gives better returns?

Bank A: SI = (50,000 ร 5.5 ร 2) รท 100 = โน5,500
Bank B: SI = (50,000 ร 5.75 ร 2) รท 100 = โน5,750

Bank B offers โน250 more in interest, so it's the better option for investment.

## Consumer Mathematics ๐

### Discount Calculations
Retailers often offer discounts to attract customers. The discount is calculated as a percentage of the marked price.

Discount = (Discount Percentage ร Marked Price) รท 100
Sale Price = Marked Price - Discount

**Example 5:**
A shirt marked at โน1,200 is on sale with a 25% discount. What is the sale price?
Discount = (25 ร 1,200) รท 100 = โน300
Sale Price = โน1,200 - โน300 = โน900

### Computing Final Price After Tax
After discounts are applied, taxes (like GST) are often added to get the final price.

Final Price = Discounted Price + Tax

**Example 6:**
A smartphone costs โน12,000 after a 20% discount. If GST of 18% is applied to the discounted price, what is the final price?

GST amount = (18 ร 12,000) รท 100 = โน2,160
Final Price = โน12,000 + โน2,160 = โน14,160

## Profit and Loss Calculations ๐

### Profit and Loss Percentage
In business transactions, it's important to know whether you're making a profit or experiencing a loss, and by what percentage.

Profit = Selling Price (SP) - Cost Price (CP)
Profit Percentage = (Profit รท CP) ร 100%

Loss = Cost Price (CP) - Selling Price (SP)
Loss Percentage = (Loss รท CP) ร 100%

**Example 7:**
Rahul buys a bicycle for โน6,000 and sells it for โน6,900. What is his profit percentage?

Profit = โน6,900 - โน6,000 = โน900
Profit Percentage = (900 รท 6,000) ร 100% = 15%

**Example 8:**
Meena buys a watch for โน2,400 and sells it for โน2,160. What is her loss percentage?

Loss = โน2,400 - โน2,160 = โน240
Loss Percentage = (240 รท 2,400) ร 100% = 10%

## Loans and EMI Calculations ๐ณ

### Loan Amount Calculation
When taking a loan, you eventually pay back the principal plus interest.

Total Repayment = Principal + Simple Interest

**Example 9:**
Amit borrows โน50,000 at 8% simple interest for 3 years. How much will he repay in total?

Interest = (50,000 ร 8 ร 3) รท 100 = โน12,000
Total Repayment = โน50,000 + โน12,000 = โน62,000

### Equal Installments
Sometimes loans are repaid in equal installments (EMIs). For simple interest loans, this can be calculated as:

EMI = Total Repayment รท Number of Installments

**Example 10:**
If Sanjay repays a loan of โน30,000 plus interest of โน4,500 in 15 equal monthly installments, what is the EMI amount?

Total Repayment = โน30,000 + โน4,500 = โน34,500
EMI = โน34,500 รท 15 = โน2,300 per month

## Effective Rate Calculations ๐

### Single Discount vs. Successive Discounts
Sometimes stores offer successive discounts (e.g., "20% off, then an additional 10% off"). This is not the same as a single discount of 30%.

For successive discounts: 
Final Price = Original Price ร (1 - first discount/100) ร (1 - second discount/100)

**Example 11:**
A laptop priced at โน40,000 is offered with two successive discounts of 15% and 10%. What is the final price?

After first discount: โน40,000 ร (1 - 15/100) = โน40,000 ร 0.85 = โน34,000
After second discount: โน34,000 ร (1 - 10/100) = โน34,000 ร 0.9 = โน30,600

The effective discount is โน9,400 or 23.5% (not 25%).

### Markup and Selling Price Calculation
Businesses often mark up their products above the cost price to make a profit.

Selling Price = Cost Price ร (1 + Markup Percentage/100)

**Example 12:**
A shopkeeper buys a table for โน8,000 and marks it up by 35%. What is the selling price?

Selling Price = โน8,000 ร (1 + 35/100) = โน8,000 ร 1.35 = โน10,800

## Personal Finance Applications ๐ผ

### Saving for a Goal
To save for a specific financial goal, you can calculate how much to save regularly.

Monthly Saving = Goal Amount รท Number of Months

**Example 13:**
Neha wants to save โน36,000 for a trip in 9 months. How much should she save monthly?

Monthly Saving = โน36,000 รท 9 = โน4,000 per month

### Emergency Fund Calculation
Financial experts recommend having an emergency fund equal to 3-6 months of expenses.

**Example 14:**
If Rohit's monthly expenses are โน25,000, how much should he have in his emergency fund for 4 months?

Emergency Fund = โน25,000 ร 4 = โน100,000

## Sample Questions ๐

1. **Question:** Sita invested โน15,000 in a fixed deposit at 6.5% simple interest per annum for 3 years. How much interest will she earn?
   **Solution:** 
   SI = (P ร R ร T) รท 100
   SI = (15,000 ร 6.5 ร 3) รท 100
   SI = โน2,925

2. **Question:** A smartphone's price is reduced from โน18,000 to โน15,300. What is the discount percentage?
   **Solution:**
   Discount = 18,000 - 15,300 = โน2,700
   Discount Percentage = (2,700 รท 18,000) ร 100% = 15%

3. **Question:** Arjun bought goods for โน2,400 and sold them for โน3,000. Find his profit percentage.
   **Solution:**
   Profit = 3,000 - 2,400 = โน600
   Profit Percentage = (600 รท 2,400) ร 100% = 25%
