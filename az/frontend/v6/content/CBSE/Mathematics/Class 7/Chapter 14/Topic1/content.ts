   duration: 45,
   description: 'Learn about line symmetry, how to identify lines of symmetry in various shapes, and understand the properties of symmetrical figures.',
   explanation: `
        Line symmetry is a fundamental concept in geometry where a figure can be divided into two identical halves by a line. This line is called the line of symmetry or axis of symmetry.

        üîç Understanding Line Symmetry:
        ‚Ä¢ A figure has line symmetry if it can be folded along a line so that both halves match exactly
        ‚Ä¢ The fold line is called the line of symmetry
        ‚Ä¢ Some figures may have multiple lines of symmetry
        ‚Ä¢ The two halves are mirror images of each other

        üìù Properties of Line Symmetry:
        1. Basic Properties:
           ‚Ä¢ Each point on one side has a corresponding point on the other side
           ‚Ä¢ The line of symmetry is equidistant from corresponding points
           ‚Ä¢ The line of symmetry can be vertical, horizontal, or diagonal
           ‚Ä¢ The line of symmetry divides the figure into two congruent parts

        2. Common Shapes and Their Lines of Symmetry:
           ‚Ä¢ Square: 4 lines of symmetry (2 diagonal, 1 vertical, 1 horizontal)
           ‚Ä¢ Rectangle: 2 lines of symmetry (1 vertical, 1 horizontal)
           ‚Ä¢ Circle: Infinite lines of symmetry (any diameter)
           ‚Ä¢ Equilateral Triangle: 3 lines of symmetry
           ‚Ä¢ Regular Pentagon: 5 lines of symmetry
           ‚Ä¢ Regular Hexagon: 6 lines of symmetry

        üé® Identifying Line Symmetry:
        1. Paper Folding Method:
           ‚Ä¢ Fold the figure along a potential line
           ‚Ä¢ Check if both halves match exactly
           ‚Ä¢ If they match, it's a line of symmetry

        2. Mirror Method:
           ‚Ä¢ Place a mirror along a potential line
           ‚Ä¢ If the reflection completes the figure, it's a line of symmetry

        üåü Real-World Applications:
        1. Architecture:
           ‚Ä¢ Building designs often use symmetry
           ‚Ä¢ Taj Mahal is a perfect example of symmetrical architecture
           ‚Ä¢ Bridges often have symmetrical designs for stability

        2. Nature:
           ‚Ä¢ Butterfly wings show line symmetry
           ‚Ä¢ Most flowers have symmetrical patterns
           ‚Ä¢ Many leaves are symmetrical
           ‚Ä¢ Human face and body are roughly symmetrical

        3. Art and Design:
           ‚Ä¢ Rangoli patterns often use symmetry
           ‚Ä¢ Logo designs frequently incorporate symmetry
           ‚Ä¢ Textile patterns often feature symmetrical designs

        üí° Tips for Finding Lines of Symmetry:
        ‚Ä¢ Look for equal parts that mirror each other
        ‚Ä¢ Check for vertical, horizontal, and diagonal lines
        ‚Ä¢ Remember that not all figures have line symmetry
        ‚Ä¢ Some figures may have multiple lines of symmetry
        ‚Ä¢ Regular polygons have as many lines of symmetry as their sides

        üéØ Common Mistakes to Avoid:
        ‚Ä¢ Assuming all shapes have line symmetry
        ‚Ä¢ Missing diagonal lines of symmetry
        ‚Ä¢ Confusing rotational symmetry with line symmetry
        ‚Ä¢ Thinking all lines through the center are lines of symmetry
        ‚Ä¢ Forgetting to check if both halves match exactly

        ‚úçÔ∏è Steps to Draw Symmetrical Figures:
        1. Start with the line of symmetry
        2. Draw one half of the figure
        3. Ensure equal distances from the line of symmetry
        4. Complete the other half as a mirror image

        Remember: Line symmetry is everywhere around us! It makes designs more appealing and helps us understand balance in nature and art. üé®
