    description: 'Learn how to express very large and very small numbers using scientific notation and standard form.',
    explanation: `
        Scientific notation is a way of writing very large or very small numbers in a more manageable form. It uses powers of 10 to express numbers.

        üîç Understanding Scientific Notation:
        ‚Ä¢ A number in scientific notation is written as: a √ó 10‚Åø
        ‚Ä¢ Where 1 ‚â§ |a| < 10 and n is an integer
        ‚Ä¢ Example: 5,000,000 = 5 √ó 10‚Å∂

        üìù Rules for Converting to Scientific Notation:
        1. For Large Numbers (> 10):
           ‚Ä¢ Move decimal point left until you have a number between 1 and 10
           ‚Ä¢ Count how many places you moved (n)
           ‚Ä¢ Write as: a √ó 10‚Åø
           Example: 45,000 = 4.5 √ó 10‚Å¥

        2. For Small Numbers (< 1):
           ‚Ä¢ Move decimal point right until you have a number between 1 and 10
           ‚Ä¢ Count how many places you moved (n)
           ‚Ä¢ Write as: a √ó 10‚Åª‚Åø
           Example: 0.00045 = 4.5 √ó 10‚Åª‚Å¥

        üßÆ Operations in Scientific Notation:
        1. Multiplication:
           ‚Ä¢ Multiply the decimal numbers
           ‚Ä¢ Add the exponents
           Example: (2 √ó 10‚Å¥) √ó (3 √ó 10‚Åµ) = 6 √ó 10‚Åπ

        2. Division:
           ‚Ä¢ Divide the decimal numbers
           ‚Ä¢ Subtract the exponents
           Example: (8 √ó 10‚Å∂) √∑ (2 √ó 10‚Å¥) = 4 √ó 10¬≤

        üåü Real-World Applications:
        1. Astronomy:
           ‚Ä¢ Distance to Sun: 1.496 √ó 10‚Å∏ kilometers
           ‚Ä¢ Mass of Earth: 5.97 √ó 10¬≤‚Å¥ kilograms

        2. Microscopic World:
           ‚Ä¢ Size of bacteria: 2 √ó 10‚Åª‚Å∂ meters
           ‚Ä¢ Size of atom: 1 √ó 10‚Åª¬π‚Å∞ meters

        3. Computing:
           ‚Ä¢ Storage capacity: 1 terabyte = 1 √ó 10¬π¬≤ bytes
           ‚Ä¢ Processor speed: 3 √ó 10‚Åπ hertz

        üí° Tips for Working with Scientific Notation:
        ‚Ä¢ Always check if your answer is in proper scientific notation (1 ‚â§ |a| < 10)
        ‚Ä¢ Remember that negative exponents represent small numbers
        ‚Ä¢ Use estimation to check if your answer makes sense
        ‚Ä¢ In calculations, convert all numbers to scientific notation first

        üéØ Common Mistakes to Avoid:
        ‚Ä¢ Forgetting to adjust the decimal part when converting
        ‚Ä¢ Mixing up positive and negative exponents
        ‚Ä¢ Not converting final answers to proper scientific notation
        ‚Ä¢ Incorrectly counting decimal places

        Remember: Scientific notation helps us work with very large and very small numbers efficiently and helps us understand their relative sizes better! üöÄ
