# Lines and Angles (Chapter 5) üìê\n\nThis chapter covers the basics of lines and angles, including types of angles, relationships between lines, and how angles interact when lines intersect.\n\nKey concepts include:\n- Types of angles (complementary, supplementary, adjacent)\n- Intersecting, parallel lines, and transversals\n- Angle relationships (vertically opposite, linear pairs)\n\nBy the end, you'll be able to solve geometric problems involving lines and angles with confidence!\n`,
