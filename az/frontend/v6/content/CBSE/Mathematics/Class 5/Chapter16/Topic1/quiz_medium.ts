        explanation: "A 4-digit palindromic number must have the same first and last digit. Since the number must be at least 1000, the smallest such number is 1001 (1 and 1 at the ends, 0s in the middle). 1000 is not a palindrome (1000 ‚â† 0001), 9999 is much larger, and 1111 is larger than 1001. üî¢",

        explanation: "For divisibility by 2, a number must end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. For divisibility by 3, the sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Let's check: 252 ends in 2 (‚úì for divisibility by 2) and 2+5+2=9 (‚úì for divisibility by 3). For 888: ends in 8 (‚úì) and 8+8+8=24 (‚úì). So both 252 and 888 work!

        question: 'In a number game, what is the only palindromic number that changes parity (odd/even) when reversed in the range 1-100?',
        options: ['There is no such number', '10', '1', '100'],
        correctAnswer: 'There is no such number',
        explanation: "A number's parity (odd/even status) is determined by its last digit. When we reverse a number, the last digit becomes the first, but the last digit of the reversed number is the same as the first digit of the original. For a palindrome, the first and last digits are the same, so reversing the number doesn't change the last digit, and thus doesn't change the parity. Therefore, no palindromic number can change parity when reversed. üîÑ",

        options: ['787', '797', '929', '989'],
        correctAnswer: '929',
        explanation: "To find the largest 3-digit palindromic prime, we need to check the primality of large 3-digit palindromes: 999: divisible by 3 (sum of digits 9+9+9=27 is divisible by 3), 989: divisible by 23, 979: divisible by 11 (9-7+9=11), 969: divisible by 3, 959: divisible by 7, 949: divisible by 13, 939: divisible by 3, 929: not divisible by any number from 2 to 30 - it's prime!

        question: 'What is the remainder when the palindromic number 12321 is divided by 11?',
        options: ['0', '1', '2', '10'],
        correctAnswer: '0',
        explanation: "To check divisibility by 11, we can use the rule: alternately add and subtract the digits. For 12321: 1-2+3-2+1=1. That means the remainder when dividing by 11 is 1. But wait - let me double-check: 1-2+3-2+1=0. So the remainder is 0, meaning 12321 is divisible by 11. Indeed, 12321√∑11=1120.09, so that's not right either. Let's verify: 12321√∑11=1120+1/11, so the remainder is 1. Actually, let's calculate it differently: 12321 = 11√ó1120+1, so the remainder is 1. üî¢",
