        correctAnswer: 'You always get another palindrome',
        explanation: "When you add a palindromic number to itself, you get the same number multiplied by 2.

        explanation: "The smallest 3-digit number is 100, but it's not a palindrome (1-0-0 ‚â† 0-0-1). The smallest 3-digit palindromic number has to have the same first and last digit, so it's 101. Other options like 111 and 121 are also palindromes, but they're larger than 101. üìä",

        explanation: "To make 1221 into a larger palindrome by adding a single digit, we need to maintain symmetry. The only way to do this is to insert a digit in the middle: 12(?)21.

        correctAnswer: '3-2-23',
        explanation: "A palindromic date reads the same forwards and backwards. In the format DD-MM-YY: 3-2-23 can be written as 32223, which reads the same backwards. 1-3-23 (1323) is not a palindrome. 2-3-23 (2323) is not a palindrome. 3-3-23 (3323) is not a palindrome. Date palindromes are special days that some people celebrate as fun number games. üìÖ",

        question: 'What is the sum of all single-digit palindromic numbers?',
        options: ['9', '45', '25', '55'],
        correctAnswer: '45',
        explanation: "Every single digit is a palindrome because it reads the same forwards and backwards. The single-digit palindromic numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Their sum is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 45. This sum is the triangular number T‚Çâ, which appears in many mathematical patterns and number games. üßÆ",

            '9': 'There are 9 single-digit palindromic numbers, but their sum is 45, not 9.',
            '25': 'The sum of 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 45, not 25.',
            '55': 'The sum of 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 45, not 55.'
