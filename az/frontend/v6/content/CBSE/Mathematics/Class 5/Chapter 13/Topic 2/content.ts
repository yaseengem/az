# Division Using Repeated Subtraction ‚ûó

Division is one of the four basic operations in mathematics. One simple way to understand division is by using repeated subtraction. This method helps you see how many times a number (the divisor) can be subtracted from another number (the dividend) until nothing is left or until you can't subtract anymore. Let's explore this method step by step!

## What is Repeated Subtraction? üîÑ
Repeated subtraction means subtracting the same number again and again from a bigger number until you reach zero or a number smaller than what you are subtracting. The number of times you subtract is the answer to your division problem!

## How Does It Work? üìù
Suppose you want to divide 20 by 4. You keep subtracting 4 from 20 until you reach 0:
- 20 - 4 = 16 (1st time)
- 16 - 4 = 12 (2nd time)
- 12 - 4 = 8 (3rd time)
- 8 - 4 = 4 (4th time)
- 4 - 4 = 0 (5th time)

You subtracted 4 a total of 5 times. So, 20 √∑ 4 = 5.

## Step-by-Step Example: 18 √∑ 3
Let's divide 18 by 3 using repeated subtraction:
1. 18 - 3 = 15 (1)
2. 15 - 3 = 12 (2)
3. 12 - 3 = 9 (3)
4. 9 - 3 = 6 (4)
5. 6 - 3 = 3 (5)
6. 3 - 3 = 0 (6)

You subtracted 3 a total of 6 times. So, 18 √∑ 3 = 6.

## Why Use Repeated Subtraction? ü§î
- **Simple**: Easy to understand, especially for small numbers.
- **Visual**: Helps you see what division means.
- **Foundation**: Builds a strong base for understanding division and multiplication.

## More Examples üìö
### Example 1: 15 √∑ 5
- 15 - 5 = 10 (1)
- 10 - 5 = 5 (2)
- 5 - 5 = 0 (3)
So, 15 √∑ 5 = 3

### Example 2: 24 √∑ 6
- 24 - 6 = 18 (1)
- 18 - 6 = 12 (2)
- 12 - 6 = 6 (3)
- 6 - 6 = 0 (4)
So, 24 √∑ 6 = 4

### Example 3: 17 √∑ 4
- 17 - 4 = 13 (1)
- 13 - 4 = 9 (2)
- 9 - 4 = 5 (3)
- 5 - 4 = 1 (4)
Now, 1 is less than 4, so we stop. We subtracted 4 a total of 4 times, and 1 is left over. So, 17 √∑ 4 = 4 remainder 1.

## Practice Questions ‚ùì
1. Divide 21 by 7 using repeated subtraction.
2. Divide 30 by 5 using repeated subtraction.
3. Divide 19 by 3 using repeated subtraction.

## Sample Questions with Answers üìù
1. **Question:** What is 16 √∑ 4 using repeated subtraction?
   **Answer:** 4
2. **Question:** Divide 25 by 6 using repeated subtraction. What is the remainder?
   **Answer:** 4 times, remainder 1
3. **Question:** How many times can you subtract 8 from 40 before reaching zero?
   **Answer:** 5 times

## Summary ‚ú®
Repeated subtraction is a simple and effective way to understand division. It helps you see how division works and prepares you for more advanced methods. Practice with different numbers to become confident in division! üëç
