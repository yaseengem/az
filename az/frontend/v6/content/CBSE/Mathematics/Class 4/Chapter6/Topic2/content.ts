# Understanding Money, Earnings, and Expenditure 💰

Money is an important part of our daily lives! It helps us buy things we need and want. In this topic, we'll learn about money, how people earn it, how they spend it, and some basic ideas about saving and managing money. Let's get started! 🚀

## What is Money? 💵

Money is what we use to buy things. In India, our currency is the Indian Rupee (₹). Money comes in the form of:

### Coins 🪙
- We have coins of different values: ₹1, ₹2, ₹5, and ₹10
- Coins are made of metal and are durable
- They are useful for small purchases

### Notes (Bills) 💸
- We have notes of different values: ₹10, ₹20, ₹50, ₹100, ₹200, ₹500, and ₹2000
- Notes are made of special paper
- They are lighter to carry than coins of the same value

## Values of Money 📊

Each coin and note has a specific value. We need to understand these values to use money correctly.

### Comparing Values
- ₹10 is greater than ₹5
- ₹100 is greater than ₹50
- ₹2000 is the highest value note

### Equivalent Values
Different combinations of money can have the same total value:
- 2 notes of ₹10 = 1 note of ₹20
- 5 coins of ₹2 = 1 note of ₹10
- 2 notes of ₹50 = 1 note of ₹100

### Example 📌
If you have 3 notes of ₹20 and 4 coins of ₹5, the total value is:
- 3 × ₹20 = ₹60 (from the notes)
- 4 × ₹5 = ₹20 (from the coins)
- Total: ₹60 + ₹20 = ₹80

## Earning Money 💼

People earn money by working at different jobs. The money they earn is called their income or earnings.

### Ways People Earn Money
- **Salaries**: Money earned by working in an office, school, hospital, etc.
- **Daily Wages**: Money earned each day for work done, like construction workers
- **Business Income**: Money earned by selling products or services
- **Farming Income**: Money earned by growing and selling crops

### Example 📌
If Ravi earns ₹200 per day and works for 5 days in a week, his weekly earnings will be:
- ₹200 × 5 = ₹1000

## Spending Money (Expenditure) 🛒

When we use money to buy things or pay for services, we are spending money. This is called expenditure.

### Common Expenses
- Food 🍎
- Clothing 👕
- Shelter (home) 🏠
- Education (school fees, books) 📚
- Transportation 🚌
- Healthcare 🏥

### Example 📌
If Meena spends ₹25 on a notebook, ₹10 on a pencil, and ₹15 on an eraser, her total expenditure is:
- ₹25 + ₹10 + ₹15 = ₹50

## Savings 🐖

Savings is the money left after spending. It's important to save money for future needs.

### How to Calculate Savings
Savings = Income - Expenditure

### Example 📌
If Amit earns ₹500 in a week and spends ₹350, his savings are:
- ₹500 - ₹350 = ₹150

## Profit and Loss 📈📉

When people buy and sell things, they may make a profit or suffer a loss.

### Profit
Profit happens when the selling price is more than the cost price.
- Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price

### Loss
Loss happens when the selling price is less than the cost price.
- Loss = Cost Price - Selling Price

### Example 📌
If a shopkeeper buys a box of chocolates for ₹200 and sells it for ₹250, the profit is:
- ₹250 - ₹200 = ₹50 profit

If a shopkeeper buys fruits for ₹300 and sells them for ₹280, the loss is:
- ₹300 - ₹280 = ₹20 loss

## Budgeting 📝

A budget is a plan for how to spend and save money. It helps us manage our money wisely.

### Simple Budget Steps
1. Write down how much money you have
2. List what you need to buy and their costs
3. Make sure your total spending doesn't exceed your money

### Example 📌
Sita has ₹100. She wants to buy:
- A book for ₹40
- Colored pencils for ₹30
- Lunch for ₹20

Total planned spending: ₹40 + ₹30 + ₹20 = ₹90
Money left: ₹100 - ₹90 = ₹10

## Borrowing and Lending 🤝

Sometimes people borrow (take) money from others when they need it, and they promise to return it later.

### Borrowing
When you take money from someone with a promise to return it.

### Lending
When you give money to someone who promises to return it to you.

### Example 📌
If Rohan borrows ₹500 from his father and returns ₹200 after one week, he still needs to return:
- ₹500 - ₹200 = ₹300

## Simple Transactions 💱

A transaction is an exchange of money for goods or services.

### Types of Transactions
- **Buying**: Giving money and receiving goods or services
- **Selling**: Giving goods or services and receiving money
- **Saving**: Putting money aside for future use
- **Donating**: Giving money without expecting anything in return

### Example 📌
When you buy an ice cream for ₹15, you give ₹15 to the seller and receive an ice cream. This is a buying transaction.

## Simple Interest Rate Problems 📊

Sometimes when you borrow money, you need to pay back a little extra as a fee for borrowing. This extra amount is called interest.

### Example 📌
If you borrow ₹100 from a friend and agree to pay back ₹110 after a month, the interest is:
- ₹110 - ₹100 = ₹10

## Practice Examples 🏋️‍♀️

Let's solve some practice examples to better understand these concepts:

### Example 1: Making Change
Raju buys a toy for ₹85 and gives the shopkeeper a ₹100 note. How much change should he receive?
- Change = ₹100 - ₹85 = ₹15

### Example 2: Daily Earnings
Seema earns ₹25 per hour. If she works for 6 hours in a day, how much does she earn?
- Earnings = ₹25 × 6 = ₹150

### Example 3: Weekly Expenditure
Rahul spends ₹20 on lunch each day. How much does he spend in a week (7 days)?
- Expenditure = ₹20 × 7 = ₹140

### Example 4: Savings
Anita earns ₹300 per week. She spends ₹200 on food and ₹50 on travel. How much does she save?
- Savings = ₹300 - (₹200 + ₹50) = ₹300 - ₹250 = ₹50

### Example 5: Profit Calculation
A shopkeeper buys 10 pens for ₹50 and sells them for ₹8 each. What is the profit?
- Cost price = ₹50
- Selling price = 10 × ₹8 = ₹80
- Profit = ₹80 - ₹50 = ₹30
