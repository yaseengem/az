# Basic Buying and Selling Concepts 🛒

Money is an important part of our daily lives! 💰 When we go to a shop, we buy things and pay money to the shopkeeper. Sometimes, we also sell things to others. Let's learn about these basic buying and selling concepts that will help us understand how money works in our everyday transactions!

## What is Buying and Selling? 🏪

### Buying 🛍️
- **Definition**: Buying means purchasing something by paying money.
- **Example**: When you go to a stationery shop and get a pencil by paying ₹5, you are buying the pencil.
- **Key Terms**:
  * **Buyer**: The person who gives money and takes the item.
  * **Cost Price (CP)**: The amount of money paid by the buyer to purchase an item.

### Selling 💼
- **Definition**: Selling means giving an item to someone and receiving money in return.
- **Example**: When a shopkeeper gives you a notebook and takes ₹25 from you, the shopkeeper is selling the notebook.
- **Key Terms**:
  * **Seller**: The person who gives the item and receives money.
  * **Selling Price (SP)**: The amount of money received by the seller for an item.

## Understanding Money Transactions 💸

### Money Paid and Change Received 🪙
When you buy something, you give money to the seller. Sometimes, you might give more money than the actual cost, and then you get some money back. This is called 'change'.

**Example**:
- You want to buy a chocolate that costs ₹15.
- You give a ₹20 note to the shopkeeper.
- How much change should you get back?
  * Change = Money given - Cost of item
  * Change = ₹20 - ₹15 = ₹5
- So, you should get ₹5 back as change.

**Sample Problem**:
Ritu buys a pen for ₹12 and gives a ₹50 note to the shopkeeper. How much change should she get?
- Change = ₹50 - ₹12 = ₹38
- So, Ritu should get ₹38 as change.

### Calculating Total Cost 🧮
When you buy multiple items, you need to add up the costs to find the total amount you need to pay.

**Example**:
- You buy a pencil for ₹5, an eraser for ₹3, and a sharpener for ₹7.
- What is the total cost?
  * Total cost = ₹5 + ₹3 + ₹7 = ₹15
- So, you need to pay ₹15 in total.

**Sample Problem**:
Rajesh buys 2 notebooks for ₹20 each and 3 pens for ₹15 each. How much does he spend in total?
- Cost of notebooks = 2 × ₹20 = ₹40
- Cost of pens = 3 × ₹15 = ₹45
- Total cost = ₹40 + ₹45 = ₹85
- So, Rajesh spends ₹85 in total.

## Profit and Loss 📈📉

### Profit 📈
- **Definition**: Profit occurs when the selling price (SP) is greater than the cost price (CP).
- **Formula**: Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price
- **Example**:
  * A shopkeeper buys a toy for ₹50 and sells it for ₹65.
  * Profit = ₹65 - ₹50 = ₹15
  * So, the shopkeeper makes a profit of ₹15.

**Sample Problem**:
Meena buys 10 chocolates for ₹50 and sells them for ₹7 each. What is her profit?
- Cost Price = ₹50
- Selling Price = 10 × ₹7 = ₹70
- Profit = ₹70 - ₹50 = ₹20
- So, Meena makes a profit of ₹20.

### Loss 📉
- **Definition**: Loss occurs when the selling price (SP) is less than the cost price (CP).
- **Formula**: Loss = Cost Price - Selling Price
- **Example**:
  * A fruit seller buys 1 kg of apples for ₹80 but can only sell them for ₹65 because some apples got spoiled.
  * Loss = ₹80 - ₹65 = ₹15
  * So, the fruit seller incurs a loss of ₹15.

**Sample Problem**:
Raju buys a cricket bat for ₹250 and sells it to his friend for ₹200. What is his loss?
- Cost Price = ₹250
- Selling Price = ₹200
- Loss = ₹250 - ₹200 = ₹50
- So, Raju incurs a loss of ₹50.

## Real-Life Applications of Buying and Selling 🏫

### At the Grocery Store 🥕
When you go to a grocery store with your parents, you can observe buying and selling in action:
- Making a list of items to buy
- Checking the price of each item
- Calculating the total cost
- Paying money and receiving change

**Example**:
Your mother gives you ₹100 to buy vegetables. You buy potatoes for ₹30, tomatoes for ₹25, and onions for ₹20.
- Total cost = ₹30 + ₹25 + ₹20 = ₹75
- Change = ₹100 - ₹75 = ₹25
- So, you will have ₹25 left.

### At the School Canteen 🍎
When you buy food items at your school canteen, you are participating in a buying and selling transaction:
- Checking what items are available and their prices
- Deciding what to buy based on your money
- Paying and receiving the items

**Example**:
You have ₹20. A sandwich costs ₹15, and a fruit juice costs ₹10.
- Can you buy both? ₹15 + ₹10 = ₹25, which is more than ₹20.
- So, you can buy either the sandwich or the fruit juice, not both.

### At a Book Fair 📚
When you visit a book fair, you see many books at different prices:
- Comparing prices of similar books
- Deciding which books to buy within your budget
- Understanding discounts and offers

**Example**:
You have ₹200 to spend at a book fair. You want to buy a storybook that costs ₹120 and a puzzle book that costs ₹90.
- Total cost = ₹120 + ₹90 = ₹210
- This is more than your budget of ₹200.
- You might need to choose one book or look for less expensive options.

## Understanding Cost Per Unit 🔢

Sometimes, we need to find out how much one item costs when we know the total cost of multiple items.

**Example**:
If 5 erasers cost ₹20, how much does one eraser cost?
- Cost per eraser = Total cost ÷ Number of erasers
- Cost per eraser = ₹20 ÷ 5 = ₹4
- So, one eraser costs ₹4.

**Sample Problem**:
Rohan buys 3 packets of biscuits for ₹45. What is the cost of one packet?
- Cost per packet = ₹45 ÷ 3 = ₹15
- So, one packet of biscuits costs ₹15.

## Making Smart Money Decisions 🧠

### Comparing Prices 📊
When buying items, it's good to compare prices from different shops to get the best deal.

**Example**:
- In Shop A, 1 kg of apples costs ₹80.
- In Shop B, 1 kg of apples costs ₹75.
- Which shop offers a better deal? Shop B, because the price is lower.

### Budgeting Basics 💼
A budget is a plan for how to spend your money. It helps you make sure you don't spend more than you have.

**Example**:
You have ₹50 to spend on your birthday party. You want to buy:
- Balloons: ₹10
- Candies: ₹15
- Small gifts for friends: ₹20
- Total = ₹10 + ₹15 + ₹20 = ₹45
- This is within your budget of ₹50, so you can buy all these items.

### Saving Money 💲
Saving means keeping some money for future use instead of spending it all.

**Example**:
You get ₹100 as a gift. Instead of spending it all, you decide to:
- Spend ₹60 on a toy you want
- Save ₹40 for later
- This way, you have some money left for future needs.

## Simple Examples to Practice 🏋️‍♀️

1. **Buying Problem**:
   Rohit buys 2 kg of rice at ₹40 per kg and 1 kg of dal at ₹75 per kg. How much does he spend in total?
   - Cost of rice = 2 × ₹40 = ₹80
   - Cost of dal = 1 × ₹75 = ₹75
   - Total cost = ₹80 + ₹75 = ₹155

2. **Selling Problem**:
   Meeta sells 5 handmade cards for ₹15 each. How much money does she earn?
   - Total earning = 5 × ₹15 = ₹75

3. **Profit Problem**:
   A shopkeeper buys 10 pencils for ₹40 and sells them for ₹6 each. What is the profit?
   - Cost Price = ₹40
   - Selling Price = 10 × ₹6 = ₹60
   - Profit = ₹60 - ₹40 = ₹20

4. **Loss Problem**:
   Rahul buys a toy car for ₹85 and later sells it to his friend for ₹65. What is his loss?
   - Cost Price = ₹85
   - Selling Price = ₹65
   - Loss = ₹85 - ₹65 = ₹20
