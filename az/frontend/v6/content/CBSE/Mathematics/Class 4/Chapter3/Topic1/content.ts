# Practical Use of Numbers in Real-Life Situations 🔢

Have you ever wondered why we learn math in school? It's because numbers are everywhere around us! In this topic, we'll explore how we use numbers in our daily lives, especially when we go on trips like a journey to Bhopal.

## Numbers in Shopping 🛒

When we go shopping, we use numbers in many ways:

### Adding Items 📝
When we buy multiple items, we need to add their prices to find the total cost.

**Example:** If you buy a notebook for ₹25, a pencil for ₹5, and an eraser for ₹10, you need to find the total:
₹25 + ₹5 + ₹10 = ₹40

This tells you that you need to pay ₹40 to the shopkeeper.

### Making Change 💰
When you give money to a shopkeeper, they often need to give you change.

**Example:** If you give ₹50 for items costing ₹37, the shopkeeper calculates:
₹50 - ₹37 = ₹13

So, you should receive ₹13 as change.

### Comparing Prices 📊
When shopping, we compare prices to find the best deal.

**Example:** If one shop sells a toy for ₹120 and another shop sells the same toy for ₹95, which is cheaper?
₹120 > ₹95

The second shop is cheaper by ₹120 - ₹95 = ₹25.

### Sample Question:** Ravi buys 3 books costing ₹45 each. How much does he pay in total?
**Solution:** 3 × ₹45 = ₹135

## Numbers in Travel ✈️

When we travel to places like Bhopal, we use numbers in various ways:

### Distance 📏
We measure the distance between places in kilometers (km).

**Example:** The distance from Delhi to Bhopal is about 700 km. If we travel by car at 70 km per hour, how long will it take?
Time = Distance ÷ Speed
Time = 700 km ÷ 70 km/h = 10 hours

So, the journey will take about 10 hours.

### Time Management ⏰
When traveling, we need to keep track of time to plan our day.

**Example:** If your train to Bhopal leaves at 8:00 AM and the journey takes 9 hours, when will you reach Bhopal?
8:00 AM + 9 hours = 5:00 PM

So, you'll reach Bhopal at 5:00 PM.

### Budgeting for a Trip 💸
When planning a trip, we need to calculate the total cost.

**Example:** For a family of four traveling to Bhopal:
- Train tickets: ₹500 per person × 4 people = ₹2,000
- Hotel for 2 nights: ₹1,200 per night × 2 nights = ₹2,400
- Food for 3 days: ₹300 per day × 3 days = ₹900
- Sightseeing: ₹800

Total cost = ₹2,000 + ₹2,400 + ₹900 + ₹800 = ₹6,100

So, the family needs to budget at least ₹6,100 for the trip.

### Sample Question:** A bus can carry 40 students. How many buses are needed for 125 students?
**Solution:** 125 ÷ 40 = 3.125, which means we need 4 buses (since we can't have 0.125 of a bus).

## Numbers in Food 🍲

When cooking or eating, we use numbers too!

### Quantities in Recipes 📝
Recipes tell us how much of each ingredient to use.

**Example:** A recipe for 4 people requires 2 cups of rice. How much rice is needed for 6 people?
Rice needed = (2 cups × 6 people) ÷ 4 people = 3 cups

So, for 6 people, you need 3 cups of rice.

### Sharing Food 🍕
When sharing food, we often divide it into equal parts.

**Example:** If you have 8 chocolates to share equally among 4 friends, how many will each friend get?
8 chocolates ÷ 4 friends = 2 chocolates per friend

So, each friend gets 2 chocolates.

### Sample Question:** A packet contains 24 biscuits. How many biscuits will 3 children get if they share them equally?
**Solution:** 24 ÷ 3 = 8 biscuits per child

## Numbers in Time Management ⏱️

We use numbers to manage our time effectively.

### Daily Schedule 📅
We use time to plan our daily activities.

**Example:** School starts at 8:30 AM and ends at 3:30 PM. How long are you in school?
3:30 PM - 8:30 AM = 7 hours

So, you spend 7 hours in school.

### Planning Activities ⌚
We need to manage time for different activities.

**Example:** If you want to spend 30 minutes on homework, 45 minutes playing, and 15 minutes reading before dinner at 7:00 PM, when should you start?
Total time needed = 30 + 45 + 15 = 90 minutes = 1 hour and 30 minutes
Start time = 7:00 PM - 1 hour and 30 minutes = 5:30 PM

So, you should start at 5:30 PM.

### Sample Question:** Ravi needs to reach school by 8:15 AM. If it takes him 45 minutes to get ready and 20 minutes to walk to school, at what time should he wake up?
**Solution:** 8:15 AM - 45 minutes - 20 minutes = 7:10 AM

## Practical Problems from Daily Life 🏠

Let's solve some practical problems that you might face in daily life:

### Problem 1: Shopping 🛍️
Meera goes to the market with ₹200. She buys vegetables for ₹75, fruits for ₹60, and a packet of biscuits for ₹20. How much money does she have left?

**Solution:**
Total spent = ₹75 + ₹60 + ₹20 = ₹155
Money left = ₹200 - ₹155 = ₹45

So, Meera has ₹45 left.

### Problem 2: School Trip 🚌
A school is organizing a trip to Bhopal for 45 students. If each student contributes ₹250 and the total cost of the trip is ₹10,000, how much money will be left over?

**Solution:**
Total collected = 45 × ₹250 = ₹11,250
Money left = ₹11,250 - ₹10,000 = ₹1,250

So, ₹1,250 will be left over.

### Problem 3: Time Management ⏰
Ritu needs to catch a train at 5:30 PM. If she wants to reach the station 20 minutes early and it takes 35 minutes to travel from home to the station, by what time should she leave home?

**Solution:**
Time to leave = 5:30 PM - 20 minutes - 35 minutes = 5:30 PM - 55 minutes = 4:35 PM

So, Ritu should leave home by 4:35 PM.

## Estimation in Daily Life 📊

Sometimes, we don't need exact answers but just a good guess. This is called estimation.

### Rounding Numbers 🔄
We can round numbers to make calculations easier.

**Example:** If items cost ₹47, ₹52, and ₹29, we can estimate the total by rounding:
₹47 ≈ ₹50
₹52 ≈ ₹50
₹29 ≈ ₹30
Estimated total = ₹50 + ₹50 + ₹30 = ₹130

The exact total is ₹47 + ₹52 + ₹29 = ₹128, which is close to our estimate.

### Sample Question:** Estimate the cost of 4 books priced at ₹96 each.
**Solution:** ₹96 ≈ ₹100, so 4 × ₹100 = ₹400 (exact answer: ₹384)

## Numbers and Measurements 📏

We use numbers to measure different things:

### Length 📏
We measure length in centimeters (cm), meters (m), or kilometers (km).

**Example:** A pencil is about 15 cm long. A classroom might be 6 m wide. The distance from one city to another is measured in kilometers.

### Weight ⚖️
We measure weight in grams (g) or kilograms (kg).

**Example:** An eraser might weigh 5 g. A child might weigh 25 kg. A grown adult might weigh 70 kg.

### Capacity 🥛
We measure how much a container can hold in milliliters (ml) or liters (l).

**Example:** A small glass might hold 200 ml of water. A water bottle might hold 1 liter (1,000 ml) of water.

### Sample Question:** A water tank holds 20 liters. If you fill it with a 2-liter jug, how many times will you need to fill the jug?
**Solution:** 20 ÷ 2 = 10 times
