        question: "If a rectangle is divided into 10 equal parts and some parts are shaded to show 3/5, how many parts are shaded?",

            "2"
        ],
        correctAnswer: "6",
        explanation: "3/5 = 6/10, so 6 out of 10 equal parts should be shaded to represent 3/5. üü©",

        question: "A square is divided into 9 equal parts arranged in 3 rows and 3 columns. If the middle row is shaded, what fraction of the square is shaded?",

        correctAnswer: "1/3",
        explanation: "The middle row contains 3 of the 9 parts, so 3/9 = 1/3 of the square is shaded. üìä",

            "3/9": "3/9 = 1/3 is correct mathematically, but the simplest form is 1/3.",
