# Using Multiplication Tables in Division üî¢

Have you ever wondered how multiplication tables can help you solve division problems? Let's learn about the connection between multiplication and division and how we can use multiplication tables to divide numbers quickly! üöÄ

## The Connection Between Multiplication and Division ‚ÜîÔ∏è

Multiplication and division are related operations. They are opposites of each other, or we can say they are "inverse operations." This means that if we know one, we can find the other!

For example, if we know that 5 √ó 6 = 30, we can also find:
- 30 √∑ 5 = 6
- 30 √∑ 6 = 5

This relationship is very helpful when solving division problems. Instead of trying to directly divide, we can think: "What number times the divisor equals the dividend?"

## How to Use Multiplication Tables for Division üìù

When we divide a number (dividend) by another number (divisor), we're actually asking: "How many times does the divisor go into the dividend?"

Here's a simple process to use multiplication tables for division:

1. Identify the dividend (the number being divided) and the divisor (the number we're dividing by).
2. Ask yourself: "What number multiplied by the divisor equals the dividend?"
3. Use your knowledge of multiplication tables to find that number.
4. The number you find is your quotient (the answer to the division problem).

### Example 1: Finding 12 √∑ 3 üçé

Let's say we have 12 apples and want to distribute them equally into 3 baskets.
- The dividend is 12.
- The divisor is 3.
- We ask: "What number times 3 equals 12?"
- From our multiplication table, we know 3 √ó 4 = 12.
- Therefore, 12 √∑ 3 = 4.
- Each basket gets 4 apples.

### Example 2: Finding 24 √∑ 6 üìö

Imagine we have 24 books and want to arrange them equally on 6 shelves.
- The dividend is 24.
- The divisor is 6.
- We ask: "What number times 6 equals 24?"
- From our multiplication table, we know 6 √ó 4 = 24.
- Therefore, 24 √∑ 6 = 4.
- Each shelf gets 4 books.

## The Division Fact Family üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶

For every multiplication fact, we can write two division facts. These related facts are called a "fact family."

For example, take the fact 7 √ó 8 = 56.
From this one multiplication fact, we can write:
- 56 √∑ 7 = 8
- 56 √∑ 8 = 7

Let's look at another fact family:
- 9 √ó 6 = 54
- 54 √∑ 9 = 6
- 54 √∑ 6 = 9

Understanding these fact families helps us see the relationship between multiplication and division, making division problems easier to solve!

## Real-Life Examples of Division üåé

### Sharing Equally üçï

If you have 20 cookies and want to share them equally among 5 friends, how many cookies will each friend get?
- 20 √∑ 5 = ?
- Ask: "What number times 5 equals 20?"
- From the multiplication table: 5 √ó 4 = 20
- Therefore, 20 √∑ 5 = 4
- Each friend gets 4 cookies.

### Grouping Items üéà

If you have 30 balloons and want to put 6 balloons in each bunch, how many bunches can you make?
- 30 √∑ 6 = ?
- Ask: "What number times 6 equals 30?"
- From the multiplication table: 6 √ó 5 = 30
- Therefore, 30 √∑ 6 = 5
- You can make 5 bunches.

## Practice Problems to Try üìù

Let's try some division problems using multiplication tables:

1. 16 √∑ 4 = ?
   - Ask: "What number times 4 equals 16?"
   - From the multiplication table: 4 √ó 4 = 16
   - Therefore, 16 √∑ 4 = 4

2. 42 √∑ 7 = ?
   - Ask: "What number times 7 equals 42?"
   - From the multiplication table: 7 √ó 6 = 42
   - Therefore, 42 √∑ 7 = 6

3. 63 √∑ 9 = ?
   - Ask: "What number times 9 equals 63?"
   - From the multiplication table: 9 √ó 7 = 63
   - Therefore, 63 √∑ 9 = 7

## Tips for Using Multiplication Tables in Division üí°

1. **Learn your multiplication tables well.** The better you know your tables, the easier division will be!

2. **Look for patterns.** For example, when dividing by 5, the answers often end in 0 or 5.

3. **Use the "fact family" concept.** Remember that each multiplication fact gives you two division facts.

4. **Practice regularly.** The more you practice, the faster you'll become at using multiplication tables for division.

5. **Draw pictures** if it helps you visualize the problem. For example, drawing 15 circles and grouping them into 3 groups can help you see that 15 √∑ 3 = 5.

## Checking Your Division Answers ‚úì

To check if your division answer is correct, you can multiply your answer by the divisor. If you get the original dividend, your answer is correct!

For example, if 32 √∑ 8 = 4:
- Check: 4 √ó 8 = 32 ‚úì

If 45 √∑ 9 = 5:
- Check: 5 √ó 9 = 45 ‚úì

## Sample Problems with Solutions üìã

### Problem 1:
If 72 candies are divided equally among 8 children, how many candies will each child get?

**Solution:**
- 72 √∑ 8 = ?
- Ask: "What number times 8 equals 72?"
- From the multiplication table: 8 √ó 9 = 72
- Therefore, 72 √∑ 8 = 9
- Each child gets 9 candies.

### Problem 2:
A teacher has 36 pencils to distribute equally among 4 groups. How many pencils will each group get?

**Solution:**
- 36 √∑ 4 = ?
- Ask: "What number times 4 equals 36?"
- From the multiplication table: 4 √ó 9 = 36
- Therefore, 36 √∑ 4 = 9
- Each group gets 9 pencils.

### Problem 3:
If you have 56 marbles and put 7 marbles in each bag, how many bags will you need?

**Solution:**
- 56 √∑ 7 = ?
- Ask: "What number times 7 equals 56?"
- From the multiplication table: 7 √ó 8 = 56
- Therefore, 56 √∑ 7 = 8
- You will need 8 bags.

## Summary üìå

1. Multiplication and division are inverse operations - they undo each other.
2. For every multiplication fact, there are two related division facts (the fact family).
3. To solve a division problem using multiplication tables:
   - Identify the dividend and divisor.
   - Ask: "What number times the divisor equals the dividend?"
   - Find that number using your knowledge of multiplication tables.
   - That number is your quotient (answer).
4. Checking your division answer is simple: multiply your answer by the divisor to see if you get the original dividend.

By using multiplication tables effectively, division becomes much easier! Practice regularly, and soon you'll be able to solve division problems quickly and accurately. üåü
