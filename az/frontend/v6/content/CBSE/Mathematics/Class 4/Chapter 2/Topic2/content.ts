# Comparing Lengths 📏

When we measure things, we often need to compare their lengths to see which one is longer or shorter. Let's learn how to compare lengths using different units of measurement!

## Comparing Lengths Using the Same Unit 🧮

The easiest way to compare lengths is when they are measured in the same unit. When comparing lengths in the same unit:
- The length with the larger number is longer
- The length with the smaller number is shorter

### Example 1:
Let's compare 45 cm and 50 cm.
Since 50 is greater than 45, we can say that 50 cm is longer than 45 cm.

### Example 2:
Let's compare 3 m and 2 m.
Since 3 is greater than 2, we can say that 3 m is longer than 2 m.

## Understanding Units of Length 📊

Before we compare lengths in different units, we need to understand the common units of length:

### Millimeter (mm)
- The smallest common unit of length
- Used for very small measurements (thickness of a coin, lead of a pencil)
- 10 millimeters = 1 centimeter

### Centimeter (cm)
- Used for small measurements (length of a pencil, width of a book)
- 100 centimeters = 1 meter
- Good for measuring objects you can hold

### Meter (m)
- Standard unit of length
- Used for measuring height, width of rooms, length of cloth
- 1000 meters = 1 kilometer
- Good for measuring things like the height of a person or the length of a room

### Kilometer (km)
- Used for measuring long distances (distance between cities, length of a highway)
- 1 kilometer = 1000 meters
- Good for measuring distances that would take a long time to walk

## Relationship Between Units 🔍

To compare lengths in different units, we need to know how these units are related:

| Unit | Relationship |
|------|--------------|
| 1 km | 1000 m |
| 1 m | 100 cm |
| 1 cm | 10 mm |

Using these relationships, we can create a "ladder" of units from smallest to largest:
millimeter (mm) → centimeter (cm) → meter (m) → kilometer (km)

## Converting Units of Length 🔄

To compare lengths in different units, we first need to convert them to the same unit. Here's how:

### To convert from a larger unit to a smaller unit:
- Multiply by the conversion factor
- Example: To convert meters to centimeters, multiply by 100
  - 3 m = 3 × 100 = 300 cm

### To convert from a smaller unit to a larger unit:
- Divide by the conversion factor
- Example: To convert centimeters to meters, divide by 100
  - 250 cm = 250 ÷ 100 = 2.5 m

Let's practice with some examples:

### Example 3:
Convert 5 m to centimeters.
5 m = 5 × 100 = 500 cm

### Example 4:
Convert 3000 m to kilometers.
3000 m = 3000 ÷ 1000 = 3 km

### Example 5:
Convert 7 km to meters.
7 km = 7 × 1000 = 7000 m

## Comparing Lengths in Different Units 🧐

Now that we know how to convert between units, we can compare lengths even when they are given in different units:

### Step 1: Convert both measurements to the same unit
### Step 2: Compare the numbers

Let's practice with some examples:

### Example 6:
Compare 1 m and 90 cm.
Step 1: Convert to the same unit.
1 m = 100 cm
Step 2: Compare.
100 cm > 90 cm
Therefore, 1 m is longer than 90 cm.

### Example 7:
Compare 2500 m and 3 km.
Step 1: Convert to the same unit.
3 km = 3000 m
Step 2: Compare.
3000 m > 2500 m
Therefore, 3 km is longer than 2500 m.

## Addition and Subtraction of Lengths 🧮

When adding or subtracting lengths, we need to make sure we're working with the same unit. If the units are different, we need to convert them first.

### Example 8:
Add 3 m and 50 cm.
Step 1: Convert to the same unit.
3 m = 300 cm
Step 2: Add.
300 cm + 50 cm = 350 cm = 3 m 50 cm

### Example 9:
Subtract 1 m 25 cm from 3 m.
Step 1: Convert to the same unit.
3 m = 300 cm
1 m 25 cm = 125 cm
Step 2: Subtract.
300 cm - 125 cm = 175 cm = 1 m 75 cm

## Mixed Units of Length 📊

Sometimes we express length using mixed units, like "2 m 35 cm" which means 2 meters and 35 centimeters.

To convert mixed units to a single unit:
1. Convert the larger unit to the smaller unit
2. Add the smaller unit

### Example 10:
Convert 3 m 45 cm to centimeters.
Step 1: Convert meters to centimeters.
3 m = 3 × 100 = 300 cm
Step 2: Add centimeters.
300 cm + 45 cm = 345 cm

To convert a single unit to mixed units:
1. Divide by the larger unit to find how many complete larger units
2. The remainder becomes the smaller unit

### Example 11:
Convert 425 cm to meters and centimeters.
Step 1: Divide by 100 to find meters.
425 ÷ 100 = 4 with remainder 25
Step 2: The remainder becomes centimeters.
425 cm = 4 m 25 cm

## Real-Life Applications 🌍

Comparing lengths is a skill we use every day:

- **Shopping for clothes**: Comparing your height (perhaps 135 cm) with the size chart
- **Cooking**: Measuring ingredients with the right measuring tools
- **Travel**: Comparing distances between places (5 km vs 3 km)
- **Sports**: Measuring jump distances or race lengths
- **Construction**: Making sure furniture fits through doorways

## Sample Questions with Solutions 📝

### Question 1:
Ravi is 145 cm tall. Sita is 1 m 50 cm tall. Who is taller?

Solution:
Step 1: Convert to the same unit.
1 m 50 cm = 150 cm
Step 2: Compare.
150 cm > 145 cm
Therefore, Sita is taller than Ravi.

### Question 2:
A ribbon is 3 m 25 cm long. Another ribbon is 350 cm long. Which ribbon is longer?

Solution:
Step 1: Convert to the same unit.
3 m 25 cm = 325 cm
Step 2: Compare.
350 cm > 325 cm
Therefore, the second ribbon (350 cm) is longer.

## Summary 📋

- To compare lengths, we need to measure them in the same unit
- Common units of length are millimeter (mm), centimeter (cm), meter (m), and kilometer (km)
- To convert from larger units to smaller units, we multiply
- To convert from smaller units to larger units, we divide
- We use addition and subtraction with lengths after converting to the same unit

Remember, when comparing lengths:
1. Make sure both measurements are in the same unit
2. Compare the numbers to determine which is longer or shorter

The ability to compare lengths helps us make decisions in real life, from knowing if furniture will fit in a room to determining if we have enough ribbon to wrap a gift. Practice converting between units and comparing different lengths to become confident in this important math skill!
