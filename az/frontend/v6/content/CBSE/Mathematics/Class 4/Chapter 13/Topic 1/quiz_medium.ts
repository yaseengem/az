        correctAnswer: "200 m¬≤",
        explanation: "Let width = w, then length = 2w. Perimeter = 2 √ó (2w + w) = 6w = 60 m, so w = 10 m, length = 20 m. Area = 20 √ó 10 = 200 m¬≤. üîÑ",

        ],
        correctAnswer: "16 cm",
        explanation: "Area of square = 16 cm¬≤, so side length = ‚àö16 = 4 cm. Perimeter (ribbon needed) = 4 √ó side = 4 √ó 4 = 16 cm. üéÄ",
