        question: "A rectangular floor measures 6m √ó 4m. How much skirting board (baseboard) is needed to go around the perimeter if there is a doorway of 1 meter width where skirting is not required?",

            "19 meters",
            "20 meters",
            "23 meters",
            "24 meters"
        ],
        correctAnswer: "19 meters",
        explanation: "Full perimeter = 2(6+4) = 20m. With doorway removed: 20 - 1 = 19m of skirting needed. üö™",

            "20 meters": "This is the full perimeter without accounting for the doorway.",

        correctAnswer: "18 meters",
        explanation: "For a regular hexagon, perimeter = 6 √ó side length = 6 √ó 3 = 18 meters. üå∏",

            "9 meters": "This accounts for only half of the sides of the hexagon.",

        question: "A rectangular playground has a length of 25 meters and a width of 10 meters. The playground is to be enlarged by adding 5 meters to its length and 4 meters to its width. By how much will the perimeter increase?",
        options: [

        correctAnswer: "18 meters",
        explanation: "Original perimeter = 2(25+10) = 70m. New perimeter = 2(30+14) = 88m. Increase = 88 - 70 = 18m. üèÜ",
