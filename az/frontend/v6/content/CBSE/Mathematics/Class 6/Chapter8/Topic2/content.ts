   explanation: `# Addition and Subtraction of Decimals üî¢

Welcome to the world of decimal operations! üåü In this topic, we'll learn how to add and subtract decimal numbers. Let's explore these operations step by step! üöÄ

## Understanding Decimal Operations üìä

### Adding Decimals ‚ûï
1. **Align the Decimal Points**
   - Write numbers one below the other
   - Make sure decimal points are aligned
   - Add zeros if needed to make numbers the same length

2. **Add from Right to Left**
   - Start adding from the rightmost digit
   - Carry over if the sum is 10 or more
   - Place the decimal point in the answer directly below the other decimal points

### Subtracting Decimals ‚ûñ
1. **Align the Decimal Points**
   - Write numbers one below the other
   - Make sure decimal points are aligned
   - Add zeros if needed to make numbers the same length

2. **Subtract from Right to Left**
   - Start subtracting from the rightmost digit
   - Borrow if needed
   - Place the decimal point in the answer directly below the other decimal points

## Examples üìù

### Addition Example
\`\`\`
  2.35
+ 1.47
-------
  3.82
\`\`\`

### Subtraction Example
\`\`\`
4.62
- 2.35
-------
2.27
\`\`\`

## Real-Life Applications üåç

1. **Money Calculations** üí∞
   - Adding prices of items
   - Calculating change
   - Managing expenses

2. **Measurements** üìè
   - Adding lengths
   - Calculating differences in weights
   - Measuring time differences

3. **Sports** ‚öΩ
   - Calculating scores
   - Measuring distances
   - Timing events

## Practice Problems üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

1. **Example 1**: 3.25 + 1.75 = ?
   - Solution: 5.00

2. **Example 2**: 4.50 - 2.25 = ?
   - Solution: 2.25

3. **Example 3**: 1.23 + 0.45 = ?
   - Solution: 1.68

## Common Mistakes to Avoid ‚ùå

1. **Misalignment of Decimal Points**
   - Always align decimal points before adding or subtracting
   - Example: 2.3 + 0.45 should be written as 2.30 + 0.45

2. **Forgetting to Carry Over**
   - Remember to carry over when the sum is 10 or more
   - Example: 0.9 + 0.3 = 1.2, not 0.12

3. **Incorrect Borrowing**
   - When subtracting, borrow from the next left digit
   - Example: 2.5 - 1.7 = 0.8, not 1.2
